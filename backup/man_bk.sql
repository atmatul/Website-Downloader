If it exists, the limit is often15 characters (typical of formats related to a.out) or 16 characters(typical of formats related to coff).ar is considered a binary utility because archives of this sort aremost often used as libraries holding commonly needed subroutines.ar creates an index to the symbols defined in relocatable objectmodules in the archive when you specify the modifier s.  Once created,this index is updated in the archive whenever ar makes a change to itscontents (save for the q update operation).  An archive with such anindex speeds up linking to the library, and allows routines in thelibrary to call each other without regard to their placement in thearchive.You may use nm -s or nm --print-armap to list this index table.  If anarchive lacks the table, another form of ar called ranlib can be usedto add just the table.GNU ar can optionally create a thin archive, which contains a symbolindex and references to the original copies of the member files of thearchives.  Such an archive is useful for building libraries for usewithin a local build, where the relocatable objects are expected toremain available, and copying the contents of each object would onlywaste time and space.

Each version hasmuch in common with the others, including object file formats, mostassembler directives (often called pseudo-ops) and assembler syntax.as is primarily intended to assemble the output of the GNU C compiler gcc  for use by the linker  ld .  Nevertheless, we ve tried to make asassemble correctly everything that other assemblers for the samemachine would assemble.  Any exceptions are documented explicitly.This doesn t mean as always uses the same syntax as another assemblerfor the same architecture; for example, we know of several incompatibleversions of 680x0 assembly language syntax.Each time you run as it assembles exactly one source program.  Thesource program is made up of one or more files.  (The standard input isalso a file.)You give as a command line that has zero or more input file names.  Theinput files are read (from left file name to right).  A command lineargument (in any position) that has no special meaning is taken to bean input file name.If you give as no file names it attempts to read one input file fromthe as standard input, which is normally your terminal.  You may haveto type ctl-D to tell as there is no more program to assemble.Use -- if you need to explicitly name the standard input file in yourcommand line.If the source is empty, as produces a small, empty object file.as may write warnings and error messages to the standard error file(usually your terminal).  This should not happen when  a compiler runsas automatically.  Warnings report an assumption made so that as couldkeep assembling a flawed program; errors report a grave problem thatstops the assembly.If you are invoking as via the GNU C compiler, you can use the -Waoption to pass arguments through to the assembler.  The assemblerarguments must be separated from each other (and the -Wa) by commas.For example:        gcc -c -g -O -Wa,-alh,-L file.c@file    Read command-line options from file.  The options read are inserted    in place of the original @file option.  If file does not exist, or    cannot be read, then the option will be treated literally, and not    removed.    Options in file are separated by whitespace.  A whitespace    character may be included in an option by surrounding the entire    option in either single or double quotes.  Any character (including    a backslash) may be included by prefixing the character to be    included with a backslash.

Similarly reducing    this value can reduce the memory requirements at the expense of    speed.--reduce-memory-overheads    This option reduces GAS s memory requirements, at the expense of    making the assembly processes slower.  Currently this switch is a    synonym for --hash-size=4051, but in the future it may have other    effects as well.--statistics    Print the maximum space (in bytes) and total time (in seconds) used    by assembly.--strip-local-absolute    Remove local absolute symbols from the outgoing symbol table.-v-version    Print the as version.--version    Print the as version and exit.-W--no-warn    Suppress warning messages.--fatal-warnings    Treat warnings as errors.--warn    Don t suppress warning messages or treat them as errors.-w  Ignored.-x  Ignored.-Z  Generate an object file even after errors.-- | files ...    Standard input, or source files to assemble.The following options are available when as is configured for an Alphaprocessor.-mcpu    In order to support existing practice in OSF/1 with respect to     .arch , and existing practice within MILO (the Linux ARC    bootloader), the numbered processor names (e.g. 21064) enable the    processor-specific PALcode instructions, while the  electro-vlasic     names (e.g.  ev4 ) do not.-mdebug-no-mdebug    Enables or disables the generation of  .mdebug  encapsulation for    stabs directives and procedure descriptors.  The default is to    automatically enable  .mdebug  when the first stabs directive is    seen.-relax    This option forces all relocations to be put into the object file,    instead of saving space and resolving some relocations at assembly    time.  Note that this option does not propagate all symbol    arithmetic into the object file, because not all symbol arithmetic    can be represented.  However, the option can still be useful in    specific applications.-replace-noreplace    Enables or disables the optimization of procedure calls, both at    assemblage and at link time.  These options are only available for    VMS targets and  -replace  is the default.  See section 1.4.1 of    the OpenVMS Linker Utility Manual.-g  This option is used when the compiler generates debug information.    When gcc is using mips-tfile to generate debug information for    ECOFF, local labels must be passed through to the object file.    Otherwise this option has no effect.-Gsize    A local common symbol larger than size is placed in  .bss , while    smaller symbols are placed in  .sbss .-F-32addr    These options are ignored for backward compatibility.The following options are available when as is configured for an ARCprocessor.-marc[5|6|7|8]    This option selects the core processor variant.-EB | -EL    Select either big-endian (-EB) or little-endian (-EL) output.The following options are available when as is configured for the ARMprocessor family.-mcpu=processor[+extension...]    Enable Thumb only instruction decoding.-mapcs-32 | -mapcs-26 | -mapcs-float | -mapcs-reentrant    Select which procedure calling convention is in use.-EB | -EL    Select either big-endian (-EB) or little-endian (-EL) output.-mthumb-interwork    Specify that the code has been generated with interworking between    Thumb and ARM code in mind.-k  Specify that PIC code has been generated.The following options are available when as is configured for theBlackfin processor family.-mcpu=processor[-sirevision]    This option specifies the target processor.  The optional    sirevision is not used in assembler.  It s here such that GCC can    easily pass down its  -mcpu=  option.  The assembler will issue an    error message if an attempt is made to assemble an instruction    which will not execute on the target processor.  The following    processor names are recognized:  bf504 ,  bf506 ,  bf512 ,  bf514 ,     bf516 ,  bf518 ,  bf522 ,  bf523 ,  bf524 ,  bf525 ,  bf526 ,     bf527 ,  bf531 ,  bf532 ,  bf533 ,  bf534 ,  bf535  (not    implemented yet),  bf536 ,  bf537 ,  bf538 ,  bf539 ,  bf542 ,     bf542m ,  bf544 ,  bf544m ,  bf547 ,  bf547m ,  bf548 ,  bf548m ,     bf549 ,  bf549m ,  bf561 , and  bf592 .-mfdpic    Assemble for the FDPIC ABI.-mno-fdpic-mnopic    Disable -mfdpic.See the info pages for documentation of the CRIS-specific options.The following options are available when as is configured for a D10Vprocessor.-O  Optimize output by parallelizing instructions.The following options are available when as is configured for a D30Vprocessor.-O  Optimize output by parallelizing instructions.-n  Warn when nops are generated.-N  Warn when a nop after a 32-bit multiply instruction is generated.The following options are available when as is configured for an i386-n  By default, x86 GAS replaces multiple nop instructions used for    alignment within code sections with multi-byte nop instructions    such as leal 0(%esi,1),%esi.  This switch disables the    optimization.--divide    On SVR4-derived platforms, the character / is treated as a comment    character, which means that it cannot be used in expressions.  The    --divide option turns / into a normal character.  This does not    disable / at the beginning of a line starting a comment, or affect    using # for starting a comment.-march=CPU[+EXTENSION...]    This option specifies the target processor.  The assembler will    issue an error message if an attempt is made to assemble an    instruction which will not execute on the target processor.  The    following processor names are recognized:  i8086 ,  i186 ,  i286 ,     i386 ,  i486 ,  i586 ,  i686 ,  pentium ,  pentiumpro ,     pentiumii ,  pentiumiii ,  pentium4 ,  prescott ,  nocona ,     core ,  core2 ,  corei7 ,  l1om ,  k1om ,  k6 ,  k6_2 ,  athlon ,     opteron ,  k8 ,  amdfam10 ,  bdver1 ,  bdver2 ,  generic32  and     generic64 .    In addition to the basic instruction set, the assembler can be told    to accept various extension mnemonics.  For example,     -march=i686+sse4+vmx  extends i686 with sse4 and vmx.  The    following extensions are currently supported: 8087, 287, 387,     no87 ,  mmx ,  nommx ,  sse ,  sse2 ,  sse3 ,  ssse3 ,  sse4.1 ,     sse4.2 ,  sse4 ,  nosse ,  avx ,  avx2 ,  noavx ,  vmx ,  smx ,     xsave ,  xsaveopt ,  aes ,  pclmul ,  fsgsbase ,  rdrnd ,  f16c ,     bmi2 ,  fma ,  movbe ,  ept ,  lzcnt ,  invpcid ,  clflush ,     lwp ,  fma4 ,  xop ,  syscall ,  rdtscp ,  3dnow ,  3dnowa ,     sse4a ,  sse5 ,  svme ,  abm  and  padlock .  Note that rather    than extending a basic instruction set, the extension mnemonics    starting with  no  revoke the respective functionality.    When the  .arch  directive is used with -march, the  .arch     directive will take precedent.-mtune=CPU    This option specifies a processor to optimize for. When used in    conjunction with the -march option, only instructions of the    processor specified by the -march option will be generated.    Valid CPU values are identical to the processor list of -march=CPU.-msse2avx    This option specifies that the assembler should encode SSE    instructions with VEX prefix.-msse-check=none-msse-check=warning-msse-check=error    These options control if the assembler should check SSE-mmnemonic=att-mmnemonic=intel    This option specifies instruction mnemonic for matching    instructions.  The  .att_mnemonic  and  .intel_mnemonic  directives    will take precedent.-msyntax=att-msyntax=intel    This option specifies instruction syntax when processing    instructions.  The  .att_syntax  and  .intel_syntax  directives    will take precedent.-mnaked-reg    This opetion specifies that registers don t require a % prefix.    The  .att_syntax  and  .intel_syntax  directives will take    precedent.The following options are available when as is configured for the Intel80960 processor.-ACA | -ACA_A | -ACB | -ACC | -AKA | -AKB | -AKC | -AMC    Specify which variant of the 960 architecture is the target.-b  Add code to collect statistics about branches taken.-no-relax    Do not alter compare-and-branch instructions for long    displacements; error if necessary.The following options are available when as is configured for theUbicom IP2K series.-mip2022ext    Specifies that the extended IP2022 instructions are allowed.-mip2022    Restores the default behaviour, which restricts the permitted    instructions to just the basic IP2022 ones.The following options are available when as is configured for theRenesas M32C and M16C processors.-m32c    Assemble M32C instructions.-m16c    Assemble M16C instructions (the default).-relax    Enable support for link-time relaxations.-h-tick-hex    Support H 00 style hex constants in addition to 0x00 style.--no-warn-explicit-parallel-conflicts or --Wnp    Do not produce warning messages when questionable parallel    constructs are encountered.The following options are available when as is configured for theMotorola 68000 series.-l  Shorten references to undefined symbols, to one word instead of    two.-m68000 | -m68008 | -m68010 | -m68020 | -m68030| -m68040 | -m68060 | -m68302 | -m68331 | -m68332| -m68333 | -m68340 | -mcpu32 | -m5200    Specify what processor in the 68000 family is the target.  The    default is normally the 68020, but this can be changed at    configuration time.-m68881 | -m68882 | -mno-68881 | -mno-68882    The target machine does (or does not) have a floating-point    coprocessor.  The default is to assume a coprocessor for 68020,    68030, and cpu32.  Although the basic 68000 is not compatible with    the 68881, a combination of the two can be specified, since it s    possible to do emulation of the coprocessor instructions with the    main processor.-m68851 | -mno-68851    The target machine does (or does not) have a memory-management unit    coprocessor.  The default is to assume an MMU for 68020 and up.For details about the PDP-11 machine dependent features options, seePDP-11-Options.-mpic | -mno-pic    Generate position-independent (or position-dependent) code.

This concerns    conditional branches, unconditional branches and branches to a sub    routine.-S | --short-branches    Do not turn relative branches into absolute ones when the offset is    out of range.--strict-direct-mode    Do not turn the direct addressing mode into extended addressing    mode when the instruction does not support direct addressing mode.--print-insn-syntax    Print the syntax of instruction in case of error.--print-opcodes    print the list of instructions with syntax and then exit.--generate-example    print an example of instruction for each possible instruction and    then exit.  This option is only useful for testing as.The following options are available when as is configured for the SPARCarchitecture:-Av6 | -Av7 | -Av8 | -Asparclet | -Asparclite-Av8plus | -Av8plusa | -Av9 | -Av9a    Explicitly select a variant of the SPARC architecture.    -Av8plus and -Av8plusa select a 32 bit environment.  -Av9 and -Av9a    select a 64 bit environment.    -Av8plusa and -Av9a enable the SPARC V9 instruction set with    UltraSPARC extensions.-xarch=v8plus | -xarch=v8plusa    For compatibility with the Solaris v9 assembler.  These options are    equivalent to -Av8plus and -Av8plusa, respectively.    Sets the CPU version being compiled for.-merrors-to-file FILENAME    Redirect error output to a file, for broken systems which don t    support such behaviour in the shell.The following options are available when as is configured for a MIPSprocessor.-G num    This option sets the largest size of an object that can be    referenced implicitly with the  gp  register.  It is only accepted    for targets that use ECOFF format, such as a DECstation running    Ultrix.  The default value is 8.-EB Generate  big endian  format output.-EL Generate  little endian  format output.-mips1-mips2-mips3-mips4-mips5-mips32-mips32r2-mips64-mips64r2    Generate code for a particular MIPS Instruction Set Architecture    level.  -mips1 is an alias for -march=r3000, -mips2 is an alias for    -march=r6000, -mips3 is an alias for -march=r4000 and -mips4 is an    alias for -march=r8000.  -mips5, -mips32, -mips32r2, -mips64, and    -mips64r2 correspond to generic MIPS V, MIPS32, MIPS32 Release 2,    MIPS64, and MIPS64 Release 2 ISA processors, respectively.-march=CPU    Generate code for a particular MIPS cpu.-mtune=cpu    Schedule and tune for a particular MIPS cpu.-mfix7000-mno-fix7000    Cause nops to be inserted if the read of the destination register    of an mfhi or mflo instruction occurs in the following two    instructions.-mdebug-no-mdebug    Cause stabs-style debugging output to go into an ECOFF-style    .mdebug section instead of the standard ELF .stabs sections.-mpdr-mno-pdr    Generate code for the MIPS 16 processor.  This is equivalent to    putting  .set mips16  at the start of the assembly file.    -no-mips16 turns off this option.-mmicromips-mno-micromips    Generate code for the microMIPS processor.  This is equivalent to    putting  .set micromips  at the start of the assembly file.    -mno-micromips turns off this option.  This is equivalent to    putting  .set nomicromips  at the start of the assembly file.-msmartmips-mno-smartmips    Enables the SmartMIPS extension to the MIPS32 instruction set. This    is equivalent to putting  .set smartmips  at the start of the    assembly file.  -mno-smartmips turns off this option.-mips3d-no-mips3d    Generate code for the MIPS-3D Application Specific Extension.  This    tells the assembler to accept MIPS-3D instructions.  -no-mips3d    turns off this option.-mdmx-no-mdmx    Generate code for the MDMX Application Specific Extension.  This    tells the assembler to accept MDMX instructions.  -no-mdmx turns    off this option.-mdsp-mno-dsp    Generate code for the DSP Release 1 Application Specific Extension.    This tells the assembler to accept DSP Release 1 instructions.    -mno-dsp turns off this option.-mdspr2-mno-dspr2    Generate code for the DSP Release 2 Application Specific Extension.    This option implies -mdsp.  This tells the assembler to accept DSP    Release 2 instructions.  -mno-dspr2 turns off this option.-mmt-mno-mt    Generate code for the MT Application Specific Extension.  This    tells the assembler to accept MT instructions.  -mno-mt turns off    this option.-mmcu-mno-mcu    Generate code for the MCU Application Specific Extension.  This    tells the assembler to accept MCU instructions.  -mno-mcu turns off    this option.--construct-floats    debugging information or store symbol table information, and    default endianness.  The available configuration names are:    mipsecoff, mipself, mipslecoff, mipsbecoff, mipslelf, mipsbelf.    The first two do not alter the default endianness from that of the    primary target for which the assembler was configured; the others    change the default to little- or big-endian as indicated by the b    or l in the name.  Using -EB or -EL will override the endianness    selection in any case.    This option is currently supported only when the primary target as    is configured for is a MIPS ELF or ECOFF target.  Furthermore, the    primary target or others specified with --enable-targets=... at    configuration time must include support for the other format, if    both are to be available.  For example, the Irix 5 configuration    includes support for both.    Eventually, this option will support more configurations, with more    fine-grained control over the assembler s behavior, and will be    supported for more processors.-nocpp    as ignores this option.  It is accepted for compatibility with the    native tools.--trap--no-trap--break--no-break    Control how to deal with multiplication overflow and division by    zero.  --trap or --no-break (which are synonyms) take a trap    exception (and only work for Instruction Set Architecture level 2    and higher); --break or --no-trap (also synonyms, and the default)    take a break exception.-n  When this option is used, as will issue a warning every time it    generates a nop instruction from a macro.The following options are available when as is configured for an MCoreprocessor.-jsri2bsr-nojsri2bsr    Enable or disable the JSRI to BSR transformation.  By default this    is enabled.  The command line option -nojsri2bsr can be used to    disable it.-sifilter-nosifilter    Enable or disable the silicon filter behaviour.

By default, all    instructions are permitted.    The following values of arch are accepted:  c62x ,  c64x ,  c64x+ ,     c67x ,  c67x+ ,  c674x .-mdsbt-mno-dsbt    The -mdsbt option causes the assembler to generate the     Tag_ABI_DSBT  attribute with a value of 1, indicating that the    code is using DSBT addressing.  The -mno-dsbt option, the default,    causes the tag to have a value of 0, indicating that the code does    not use DSBT addressing.  The linker will emit a warning if objects    of different type (DSBT and non-DSBT) are linked together.-mpid=no-mpid=near-mpid=far    The -mpid= option causes the assembler to generate the     Tag_ABI_PID  attribute with a value indicating the form of data    addressing used by the code.  -mpid=no, the default, indicates    position-dependent data addressing, -mpid=near indicates position-    independent addressing with GOT accesses using near DP addressing,    and -mpid=far indicates position-independent addressing with GOT    accesses using far DP addressing.  The linker will emit a warning    if objects built with different settings of this option are linked    together.-mlittle-endian    Generate code for the specified endianness.  The default is little-    endian.The following options are available when as is configured for a TILE-Gxprocessor.-m32 | -m64    Select the word size, either 32 bits or 64 bits.The following options are available when as is configured for an Xtensaprocessor.--text-section-literals | --no-text-section-literals    Control the treatment of literal pools.  The default is    --no-text-section-literals, which places literals in separate    sections in the output file.  This allows the literal pool to be    placed in a data RAM/ROM.  With --text-section-literals, the    literals are interspersed in the text section in order to keep them    as close as possible to their references.  This may be necessary    for large assembly files, where the literals would otherwise be out    of range of the  L32R  instructions in the text section.  These    options only affect literals referenced via PC-relative  L32R     instructions; literals for absolute mode  L32R  instructions are    handled separately.--absolute-literals | --no-absolute-literals    Indicate to the assembler whether  L32R  instructions use absolute    or PC-relative addressing.  If the processor includes the absolute    addressing option, the default is to use absolute  L32R     relocations.  Otherwise, only the PC-relative  L32R  relocations    can be used.--target-align | --no-target-align    Enable or disable automatic alignment to reduce branch penalties at    some expense in code size.    This optimization is enabled by    default.  Note that the assembler will always align instructions    like  LOOP  that have fixed alignment requirements.--longcalls | --no-longcalls    Enable or disable transformation of call instructions to allow    calls across a greater range of addresses.    This option should be    used when call targets can potentially be out of range.  It may    degrade both code size and performance, but the linker can    generally optimize away the unnecessary overhead when a call ends    up within range.  The default is --no-longcalls.--transform | --no-transform    Enable or disable all assembler transformations of Xtensa    instructions, including both relaxation and optimization.  The    default is --transform; --no-transform should only be used in the    rare cases when the instructions must be exactly as specified in    the assembly source.  Using --no-transform causes out of range    instruction operands to be errors.

A local cache of webpages and e-mails from the BTS may also be created and updated.In general, the command line interface is the same as what you wouldwrite in a mail to control@bugs.debian.org, just prefixed with  bts .For example: % bts severity 69042 normal % bts merge 69042 43233 % bts retitle 69042 blah blahA few additional commands have been added for your convenience, andthis program is less strict about what constitutes a valid bug number.For example,  severity Bug#85942 normal  is understood, as is  severity#85942 normal .  (Of course, your shell may regard  #  as a commentcharacter though, so you may need to quote it!)Also, for your convenience, this program allows you to abbreviatecommands to the shortest unique substring (similar to how cvs lets youabbreviate commands). So it understands things like  bts cl 85942 .It is also possible to include a comment in the mail sent to the BTS.If your shell does not strip out the comment in a command like  btsseverity 30321 normal #inflated severity , then this program is smartenough to figure out where the comment is, and include it in the email.Note that most shells do strip out such comments before they get to theprogram, unless the comment is quoted.  (Something like  bts severity#85942 normal  will not be treated as a comment!)You can specify multiple commands by separating them with a single dot,rather like update-rc.d; a single comma may also be used; all thecommands will then be sent in a single mail. It is important thedot/comma is surrounded by whitespace so it is not mistaken for part ofa command.  For example (quoting where necessary so that bts sees thecomment): % bts severity 95672 normal , merge 95672 95673 \\#they are the same!The abbreviation  it  may be used to refer to the last mentioned bugnumber, so you could write: % bts severity 95672 wishlist , retitle it  bts: please add a --foo option Please use this program responsibly, and do take our users into    Opposite of --offline; overrides any configuration file directive    to work offline.-n, --no-action    Do not send emails but print them to standard output.--cache, --no-cache    Should we attempt to cache new versions of BTS pages when    performing show/bugs commands?  Default is to cache.--cache-mode={min|mbox|full}    When running a bts cache command, should we only mirror the basic    bug (min), or should we also mirror the mbox version (mbox), or    should we mirror the whole thing, including the mbox and the boring    attachments to the BTS bug pages and the acknowledgement emails    (full)?  Default is min.--cache-delay=seconds    Time in seconds to delay between each download, to avoid hammering    the BTS web server. Default is 5 seconds.--mbox    Open a mail reader to read the mbox corresponding to a given bug    number for show and bugs commands.--mailreader=READER    Specify the command to read the mbox.  Must contain a  %s  string    (unquoted!), which will be replaced by the name of the mbox file.    The command will be split on white space and will not be passed to    a shell.  Default is  mutt -f %s .  (Also, %% will be substituted    by a single % if this is needed.)--cc-addr=CC_EMAIL_ADDRESS    Send carbon copies to a list of users. CC_EMAIL_ADDRESS should be a    comma-separated list of emails.--use-default-cc    Add the addresses specified in the configuration file option    BTS_DEFAULT_CC to the list specified using --cc-addr.  This is the    default.--no-use-default-cc    Do not add addresses specified in BTS_DEFAULT_CC to the carbon copy    list.--sendmail=SENDMAILCMD    Specify the sendmail command.  The command will be split on white    space and will not be passed to a shell.  Default is    /usr/sbin/sendmail.  The -t option will be automatically added if    the command is /usr/sbin/sendmail or /usr/sbin/exim*.  For other    mailers, if they require a -t option, this must be included in the    SENDMAILCMD, for example: --sendmail= /usr/sbin/mymailer -t .--mutt    command.    The host name may be followed by a colon ( : ) and a port number in    order to use a port other than the default.  It may also begin with     ssmtp://  or  smtps://  to indicate that SMTPS should be used.    Note that one of $DEBEMAIL or $EMAIL must be set in the environment    in order to use direct SMTP connections to send emails.    Note that when sending directly via an SMTP host, specifying    addresses in --cc-addr or BTS_DEFAULT_CC that the SMTP host will    not relay will cause the SMTP host to reject the entire mail.    Note also that the use of the reassign command may, when either    --interactive or --force-interactive mode is enabled, lead to the    automatic addition of a Cc to $newpackage@packages.debian.org.  In    these cases, the note above regarding relaying applies.  The    submission interface (port 587) on reportbug.debian.org does not    support relaying and, as such, should not be used as an SMTP server    for bts under the circumstances described in this paragraph.--smtp-username=USERNAME, --smtp-password=PASSWORD    Specify the credentials to use when connecting to the SMTP server    specified by --smtp-host.  If the server does not require    authentication then these options should not be used.

INSERT INTO network_lab.Links (id, link, occurence, tags) VALUES (93, '/man1/buildhash', 1, 'Ispell  is fashioned after the spell program from ITS (called ispell onTwenex systems.)  The most common usage is  ispell filename .  In  thiscase,  ispell  will display each word which does not appear in the dic-tionary at the top of the screen and allow you to change it.  If  thereare   near misses  in the dictionary (words which differ by only a sin-gle letter, a missing or extra letter, a pair of transposed letters, ora  missing  space or hyphen), then they are also displayed on followinglines.  As well as  near misses , ispell may display other  guesses  atways  to  make  the word from a known root, with each guess preceded byquestion marks.  Finally, the line containing the word and the previousline  are  printed  at  the bottom of the screen.  If your terminal candisplay in reverse video, the word itself is highlighted.  You have theoption  of  replacing  the word completely, or choosing one of the sug-gested words.  Commands are  single  characters  as  follows  (case  isignored):       R      Replace the misspelled word completely.       Space  Accept the word this time only.       A      Accept the word for the rest of this ispell session.

Shell escape.       ^L     Redraw screen.       ^Z     Suspend ispell.       ?      Give help screen.If  the  -M  switch is specified, a one-line mini-menu at the bottom ofthe screen will summarize these options.  Conversely, the -N switch maybe  used  to  suppress  the  mini-menu.   (The minimenu is displayed bydefault if ispell was compiled with the MINIMENU option, but these  twoswitches will always override the default).If  the -L flag is given, the specified number is used as the number oflines of context to be shown at the bottom of the screen  (The  defaultis  to  calculate  the amount of context as a certain percentage of thescreen size).  The amount of context is  subject  to  a  system-imposedlimit.If  the  -V  flag  is  given, characters that are not in the 7-bit ANSIprintable character set will always be displayed in the style  of   cat-v ,  even if ispell thinks that these characters are legal ISO Latin-1on your system.  This is useful  when  working  with  older  terminals.Without  this  switch,  ispell will display 8-bit characters  as is  ifthey have been defined as string characters for the chosen file type. Normal  mode, as well as the -l, -a, and -A  options  and  interactivemode  (see below) also accepts the following  common  flags on the com-mand line:       -t     The input file is in TeX or LaTeX format.       -n     The input file is in nroff/troff format.       -H     The input file is  in  SGML/HTML  format.   (This  should              really  be  -s,  but for historical reasons that flag was              already taken.)       -o     The input file should be treated as ordinary text.  (This              could be used to override DEFTEXFLAG.)       -g     The  input file is in Debian control file format.  Ispell              will ignore everything outside the Description(s).       -b     Create a backup file by appending  .bak  to the  name  of              the input file.       -x     Delete the backup file after spell-checking is finished.       -B     Report run-together words with missing blanks as spelling              Specify  an  alternate dictionary file.  For example, use              -d british to  choose  /usr/lib/ispell/british.{aff|hash}              instead of your default ispell dictionary.       -p file              Specify an alternate personal dictionary.       -w chars              Specify additional characters that can be part of a word.       -W n   Specify length of words that are always legal.       -T type              Assume a given formatter type for all files.The -H, -n, -t, and -o options select whether ispell runs in HTML (-H),nroff/troff (-n), TeX/LaTeX (-t), or ordinary  text  (-o)  input  mode.mode.   (The  default mode is controlled by the DEFTEXFLAG installationoption, but is  normally  nroff/troff  mode  for  historical  reasons.)Unless overridden by one of the mode-selection switches, TeX/LaTeX modeis automatically selected if an input file has  the  extension   .tex ,and HTML mode is automatically selected if an input file has the exten-sion  .html  or  .htm .In HTML mode, HTML tags delimited by &lt;&gt; signs are skipped, except  thatthe   ALT=  construct is recognized if it appears with no spaces aroundthe equals sign, and the text inside is spell-checked.In TeX/LaTeX mode, whenever a backslash ( \\ )  is  found,  ispell  willskip  to  the next whitespace or TeX/LaTeX delimiter.  Certain commandscontain arguments which should not be checked, such as labels and  ref-erence keys as are found in the \\cite command, since they contain arbi-trary, non-word arguments.  Spell checking is also suppressed  when  inmath mode.  Thus, for example, given       \\chapter {This is a Ckapter} \\cite{SCH86}ispell  will find  Ckapter  but not  SCH .  The -t option does not rec-ognize the TeX comment character   % ,  so  comments  are  also  spell-checked.   It  also  assumes correct LaTeX syntax.  Arguments to infre-quently used commands and some optional arguments are sometimes checkedunnecessarily.  The bibliography will not be checked if ispell was com-piled with IGNOREBIB defined.   Otherwise,  the  bibliography  will  bechecked but the reference key will not.References for the tib (if available on your system), bibliography sys-tem, that is, text between a ``[.   or ``&lt;.   and ``.]   or ``.&gt;   willalways be ignored in TeX/LaTeX mode.The  -b  and  -x  options control whether ispell leaves a backup (.bak)file for each input file.  The .bak  file  contains  the  pre-correctedtext.  If there are file opening / writing errors, the .bak file may beleft for recovery purposes even with the -x option.   The  default  forthis option is controlled by the DEFNOBACKUPFLAG installation option.installation the default may vary depending  on  which  dictionary  youchoose.The  -P and -m options control when ispell automatically generates sug-gested root/affix combinations for possible addition to  your  personaldictionary.   (These are the entries in the  guess  list which are pre-ceded by question marks.)  If -P is specified, such  guesses  are  dis-played  only if ispell cannot generate any possibilities that match thecurrent dictionary.  If -m is specified, such guesses are  always  dis-played.   This can be useful if the dictionary has a limited word list,or a word list with few suffixes.  However, you should be careful  whenusing  this  option,  as  it  can generate guesses that produce illegalwords.  The default for this option is  controlled  by  the  dictionaryfile used.The  -S  option suppresses ispell s normal behavior of sorting the listof possible replacement words.  Some people may prefer this,  since  itsomewhat  enhances  the  probability that the correct word will be low-numbered.The -d option is used to specify an alternate hashed  dictionary  file,other  than  the  default.  If the filename does not contain a  / , thelibrary directory for the default dictionary file is prefixed; thus, touse  a  dictionary in the local directory  -d ./xxx.hash  must be used.This is useful to allow dictionaries for alternate  languages.   Unlikeprevious  versions  of  ispell,  a  dictionary of /dev/null is illegal,because the dictionary contains the affix table.  If you need an effec-tively  empty  dictionary,  create  a  one-entry  list with an unlikelystring (e.g.,  qqqqq ).The -p option is used to specify an alternate personal dictionary file.If the file name does not begin with  / , $HOME is prefixed.  Also, theshell variable WORDLIST may be set, which renames the personal  dictio-nary  in the same manner.  The command line overrides any WORDLIST set-ting.  If neither the -p switch nor the WORDLIST  environment  variableis given, ispell will search for a personal dictionary in both the cur-rent directory and $HOME, creating one in $HOME if none is found.   Thepreferred  name is constructed by appending  .ispell_  to the base nameof the hash file.  For example, if you use the English dictionary, yourpersonal  dictionary would be named  .ispell_english .  However, if thefile  .ispell_words  exists, it will be used as the personal dictionaryregardless  of the language hash file chosen.  This feature is includedprimarily for backwards compatibility.If the -p option is not specified, ispell will look for  personal  dic-tionaries  in  both  the  current directory and the home directory.  Ifdictionaries exist in both places, they will be merged.  If  any  wordsare  added to the personal dictionary, they will be written to the cur-rent directory if a dictionary already existed in that place; otherwisethey will be written to the dictionary in the home directory.The  -w option may be used to specify characters other than alphabeticswhich may also appear in words.  For instance, -w  &amp;  will allow  AT&amp;T to  be  picked up.  Underscores are useful in many technical documents.characters.  Use of  n  does not conflict with anything because  actualalphabetics have no meaning - alphabetics are already accepted.  Ispellwill typically be used with input from a file, meaning that  preservingparity for possible 8 bit characters from the input text is OK.  If youspecify the -l option, and actually type text from the  terminal,  thismay create problems if your stty settings preserve parity.It  is  not possible to use -w with certain characters.  In particular,the flag-marker character for the language (defined in the affix  file,but usually  / ) can never be made into a word character.The  -W  option  may  be used to change the length of words that ispellalways accepts as legal.  Normally, ispell will accept all  1-characterwords as legal, which is equivalent to specifying  -W 1.   (The defaultfor this switch is actually  controlled  by  the  MINWORD  installationoption, so it may vary at your installation.)  If you want all words tobe checked against the dictionary, regardless of length, you might wantto specify  -W 0.   On the other hand, if your document specifies a lotof three-letter acronyms, you would specify  -W 3  to accept all  wordsof  three  letters  or less.  Regardless of the setting of this option,ispell will only generate words that are in the dictionary as suggestedreplacements  for words; this prevents the list from becoming too long.Obviously, this option can be very dangerous, since short  misspellingsmay  be missed.  If you use this option a lot, you should probably makea last pass without it before you publish  your  document,  to  protectyourself against errors.The  -T  option  is used to specify a default formatter type for use ingenerating string characters.  This switch overrides the  default  typedetermined  from the file name.  The type argument may be either one ofthe unique names defined in the language affix file (e.g., nroff) or  afile  suffix  including  the dot (e.g., .tex).  If no -T option appearsand no type can be determined from the file name,  the  default  stringcharacter type declared in the language affix file will be used.The  -k option is used to enhance the behavior of certain deformatters.The name parameter gives the name of a  deformatter  keyword  set  (seebelow),  and  the  list  parameter gives a list of one or more keywordsthat are to be treated specially.  If list begins with a plus (+) sign,it  is added to the existing keywords; otherwise it replaces the exist-ing keyword list.   For  example,  -ktexskip1  +bibliographystyle  adds bibliographystyle    to   the  TeX  skip-1  list,  while  -khtmlignorepre,strong replaces the HTML ignore list with  pre  and  strong .   Thelists available are:texskip1       TeX/LaTeX  commands  that take a single argument that should not       be spell-checked, such as  bibliographystyle .  The  default  is        end ,   vspace ,   hspace ,   cite ,   ref ,  parbox ,  label ,        input ,  nocite ,   include ,   includeonly ,   documentstyle ,        documentclass ,   usepackage ,   selectlanguage ,   pagestyle ,        pagenumbering ,  hyphenation ,   pageref ,  and   psfig ,  plus        bibliography   in some installations.  These keywords are case-       sensitive.       such as HREF=, is not normally checked.)htmlcheck       Subfields  that  should  be spell-checked even inside HTML tags.       The default is  alt , so that the ALT= portion of IMG tags  will       be spell-checked.  These keywords are case-insensitive.All  of  the  above  keyword  lists can also be modified by environmentvariables whose names are the same as above, except in uppercase, e.g.,TEXSKIP1.   The  -k switch overrides (or adds to) the environment vari-ables, and the environment variables override or add  to  the  built-indefaults.The  -F switch specifies an external deformatter program.  This programshould read data from its standard input and write to its standard out-put.  The program must produce exactly one character of output for eachcharacter of input, or ispell will lose synchronization and corrupt theoutput  file.  Whitespace characters (especially blanks, tabs, and new-lines) and characters that should be  spell-checked  should  be  passedthrough  unchanged.  Characters that should not be spell-checked shouldbe converted into blanks or other non-word characters.  For example, anHTML  deformatter  might turn all HTML tags into blanks, and also blankout all text delimited by tags such as  code  or  kbd .The -F switch is the preferred way to deformat files  for  ispell,  andeventually will become the only way.If  ispell is invoked without any filenames or mode switches, it entersan interactive mode designed to let the  user  check  the  spelling  ofindividual  words.   The  program repeatedly prompts on standard outputwith  word:  and responds with either  ok  (possibly with  commentary), not found , or  how about  followed by a list of suggestions.The  -l  or   list   option to ispell is used to produce a list of mis-spelled words from the standard input.The -a option is intended to be used  from  other  programs  through  apipe.   In  this  mode, ispell prints a one-line version identificationmessage, and then begins reading lines of input.  For each input  line,a  single  line is written to the standard output for each word checkedfor spelling on the line.  If the word was found in  the  main  dictio-nary,  or  your personal dictionary, then the line contains only a  * .If the word was found through affix removal, then the line  contains  a + ,  a  space,  and the root word.  If the word was found through com-pound formation (concatenation of  two  words,  controlled  by  the  -Coption), then the line contains only a  - .If  the  word is not in the dictionary, but there are near misses, thenthe line contains an  &amp; , a space, the misspelled word,  a  space,  thenumber  of  near misses, the number of characters between the beginningof the line and the beginning of the misspelled word, a colon,  anotherspace,  and  a  list of the near misses separated by commas and spaces.Following the near misses (and identified only by  the  count  of  nearmisses),  if  the word could be formed by adding (illegal) affixes to anary.Finally, if the word does not appear in the dictionary, and  there  areno  near  misses, then the line contains a  # , a space, the misspelledword, a space, and the character offset from the beginning of the line.Each  sentence  of  text  input  is terminated with an additional blankline, indicating that ispell has completed processing the input line.These output lines can be summarized as follows:       OK:    *       Root:  + &lt;root&gt;       Compound:              -       Miss:  &amp;  &lt;original&gt;  &lt;count&gt;  &lt;offset&gt;:  &lt;miss&gt;,  &lt;miss&gt;,  ...,              &lt;guess&gt;, ...       Guess: ? &lt;original&gt; 0 &lt;offset&gt;: &lt;guess&gt;, &lt;guess&gt;, ...       None:  # &lt;original&gt; &lt;offset&gt;For  example,  a  dummy dictionary containing the words  fray ,  Frey , fry , and  refried  might produce the following response to  the  com-mand  echo  frqy refries | ispell -a -m -d ./test.hash :       (#) International Ispell Version 3.0.05 (beta), 08/10/91       &amp; frqy 3 0: fray, Frey, fry       &amp; refries 1 5: refried, re+fry-y+iesThis  mode is also suitable for interactive use when you want to figureout the spelling of a single word.The -A option works just like -a, except that if a line begins with thestring  &amp;Include_File&amp; , the rest of the line is taken as the name of afile to read for further words.  Input returns  to  the  original  filewhen the include file is exhausted.  Inclusion may be nested up to fivedeep.  The key string may be  changed  with  the  environment  variableINCLUDE_STRING (the ampersands, if any, must be included).When in the -a mode, ispell will also accept lines of single words pre-fixed with any of  * ,  &amp; ,  @ ,  + ,  - ,  ~ ,  # ,  ! ,  % ,  ` ,  or ^ .  A line starting with  *  tells ispell to insert the word into theuser s dictionary (similar to the I command).  A line starting with  &amp; tells  ispell  to  insert an all-lowercase version of the word into theuser s dictionary (similar to the U command).  A line starting with  @ causes  ispell to accept this word in the future (similar to the A com-mand).  A line starting with  + , followed immediately by tex or  nroffwill  cause  ispell  to parse future input according the syntax of thatformatter.  A line consisting solely of a   +   will  place  ispell  inTeX/LaTeX  mode  (similar  to  the -t option) and  -  returns ispell tonroff/troff mode (but  these  commands  are  obsolete).   However,  thestring  character  type is not changed; the  ~  command must be used toAny  input  following the prefix characters  + ,  - ,  # ,  ! ,  % , or `  is ignored, as is any input following the filename on a   ~   line.To  allow  spell-checking  of  lines beginning with these characters, aline starting with  ^  has that character removed before it  is  passedto the spell-checking code.  It is recommended that programmatic inter-faces prefix every data line with  an  uparrow  to  protect  themselvesagainst future changes in ispell.To summarize these:       *      Add to personal dictionary       @      Accept word, but leave out of dictionary       #      Save current personal dictionary       ~      Set parameters based on filename       +      Enter TeX mode       -      Exit TeX mode       !      Enter terse mode       %      Exit terse mode       `      Enter verbose-correction mode       ^      Spell-check rest of lineIn  terse mode, ispell will not print lines beginning with  * ,  + , or - , all of which indicate correct words.  This significantly  improvesrunning speed when the driving program is going to ignore correct wordsanyway.In verbose-correction mode, ispell includes the original  word  immedi-ately after the indicator character in output lines beginning with  * , + , and  - , which simplifies interaction for some programs.The -s option is only valid in conjunction with the -a or  -A  options,and only on BSD-derived systems.  If specified, ispell will stop itselfwith a SIGTSTP signal after each line of input.  It will not read  moreinput until it receives a SIGCONT signal.  This may be useful for hand-shaking with certain text editors.The -f option is only valid in conjunction with the -a or  -A  options.If  -f  is  specified, ispell will write its results to the given file,rather than to standard output.The -v option causes ispell to print its current version identificationon the standard output and exit.  If the switch is doubled, ispell willalso print the options that it was compiled with.       BOTHER BOTHE/R BOTH/RThe -e switch is the reverse of -c; it expands affix flags to produce alist of words.  For example, the command:       echo BOTH/R | ispell -eproduces:       BOTH BOTHERAn  optional expansion level can also be specified.  A level of 1 (-e1)is the same as -e alone.

If a word is capitalized  incorrectly,the  list of possibilities will include all acceptable capitalizations.(More than one capitalization may be acceptable; for example,  my  dic-tionary lists both  ITCorp  and  ITcorp .)Normally,  this  feature will not cause you surprises, but there is onecircumstance you need to be aware of.

Then the output consists of object files output bythe assembler.Other options are passed on to one stage of processing.  Some optionscontrol the preprocessor and others the compiler itself.  Yet otheroptions control the assembler and linker; most of these are notdocumented here, since you rarely need to use any of them.Most of the command line options that you can use with GCC are usefulfor C programs; when an option is only useful with another language(usually C++), the explanation says so explicitly.  If the descriptionfor a particular option does not mention a source language, you can usethat option with all supported languages.The gcc program accepts options and file names as operands.  Manyoptions have multi-letter names; therefore multiple single-letteroptions may not be grouped: -dv is very different from -d -v.You can mix options and other arguments.

In order to be ableto distinguish these similarly named functions C++ and Java encode theminto a low-level assembler name which uniquely identifies eachdifferent version.  This process is known as mangling. The c++filt [1]program does the inverse mapping: it decodes (demangles) low-levelnames into user-level names so that they can be read.Every alphanumeric word (consisting of letters, digits, underscores,dollars, or periods) seen in the input is a potential mangled name.  Ifthe name decodes into a C++ name, the C++ name replaces the low-levelname in the output, otherwise the original word is output.  In this wayyou can pass an entire assembler source file, containing mangled names,through c++filt and see the same source file containing demanglednames.You can also use c++filt to decipher individual symbols by passing themon the command line:        c++filt &lt;symbol&gt;If no symbol arguments are given, c++filt reads symbol names from thestandard input instead.  All the results are printed on the standardoutput.  The difference between reading names from the command lineversus reading names from the standard input is that command linearguments are expected to be just mangled names and no checking isperformed to separate them from surrounding text.  Thus for example:        c++filt -n _Z1fvwill work and demangle the name to  f()  whereas:        c++filt -n _Z1fv,will not work.  (Note the extra comma at the end of the mangled namewhich makes it invalid).  This command however will work:        echo _Z1fv, | c++filt -nand will display  f(), , i.e., the demangled name followed by atrailing comma.  This behaviour is because when the names are read fromthe standard input it is expected that they might be part of an    dependent.-n--no-strip-underscores    Do not remove the initial underscore.-p--no-params    When demangling the name of a function, do not display the types of    the function s parameters.-t--types    Attempt to demangle types as well as function names.

It was a perlprogram that tried to parse out C structures and display their memberoffsets for you.  This was especially useful for people looking atbinary dumps or poking around the kernel.Pstruct was not a pretty program.  Neither was it particularly robust.The problem, you see, was that the C compiler was much better atparsing C than I could ever hope to be.So I got smart:  I decided to be lazy and let the C compiler parse theC, which would spit out debugger stabs for me to read.  These were mucheasier to parse.  It s still not a pretty program, but at least it smore robust.Pstruct takes any .c or .h files, or preferably .s ones, since that sthe format it is going to massage them into anyway, and spits outlistings like this: struct tty {   int                          tty.t_locker                         000      4   int                          tty.t_mutex_index                    004      4   struct tty *                 tty.t_tp_virt                        008      4   struct clist                 tty.t_rawq                           00c     20     int                        tty.t_rawq.c_cc                      00c      4     int                        tty.t_rawq.c_cmax                    010      4     int                        tty.t_rawq.c_cfx                     014      4     int                        tty.t_rawq.c_clx                     018      4     struct tty *               tty.t_rawq.c_tp_cpu                  01c      4   struct clist                 tty.t_outq                           04c     20     int                        tty.t_outq.c_cc                      04c      4     int                        tty.t_outq.c_cmax                    050      4     int                        tty.t_outq.c_cfx                     054      4     int                        tty.t_outq.c_clx                     058      4     struct tty *               tty.t_outq.c_tp_cpu                  05c      4     struct tty *               tty.t_outq.c_tp_iop                  060      4     unsigned char *            tty.t_outq.c_buf_cpu                 064      4     unsigned char *            tty.t_outq.c_buf_iop                 068      4   (*int)()                     tty.t_oproc_cpu                      06c      4   (*int)()                     tty.t_oproc_iop                      070      4   (*int)()                     tty.t_stopproc_cpu                   074      4   (*int)()                     tty.t_stopproc_iop                   078      4   struct thread *              tty.t_rsel                           07c      4etc.Actually, this was generated by a particular set of options.  You cancontrol the formatting of each column, whether you prefer wide or fat,hex or decimal, leading zeroes or whatever.All you need to be able to use this is a C compiler than generatesBSD/GCC-style stabs.  The -g option on native BSD compilers and GCCshould get this for you.To learn more, just type a bogus option, like -\\?, and a long usagemessage will be provided.  There are a fair number of possibilities.If you re only a C programmer, than this is the end of the message foryou.  You can quit right now, and if you care to, save off the sourceand run it when you feel like it.  Or not.But if you re a perl programmer, then for you I have something muchmore wondrous than just a structure offset printer.You see, if you call pstruct by its other incybernation, c2ph, you havea code generator that translates C code into perl code!  Well,structure and union declarations at least, but that s quite a bit.Prior to this point, anyone programming in perl who wanted to interactwith C programs, like the kernel, was forced to guess the layouts ofthe C structures, and then hardwire these into his program.  Of course,when you took your wonderfully crafted program to a system where thesgtty structure was laid out differently, your program broke.  Which isa shame.We ve had Larry s h2ph translator, which helped, but that only works oncpp symbols, not real C, which was also very much needed.  What I offeryou is a symbolic way of getting at all the C structures.  I ve couchedthem in terms of packages and functions.  Consider the followingprogram:    #!/usr/local/bin/perl    $stime =  $ru[ &amp;rusage ru_stime + &amp;timeval tv_sec  ]           + ($ru[ &amp;rusage ru_stime + &amp;timeval tv_usec ]) / 1e6;    printf  you have used %8.3fs+%8.3fu seconds.\\n , $utime, $stime;As you see, the name of the package is the name of the structure.Regular fields are just their own names.  Plus the following accessorfunctions are provided for your convenience:    struct      This takes no arguments, and is merely the number of first-level                elements in the structure.  You would use this for indexing                into arrays of structures, perhaps like this                    $usec = $u[ &amp;user u_utimer                                + (&amp;ITIMER_VIRTUAL * &amp;itimerval struct)                                + &amp;itimerval it_value                                + &amp;timeval tv_usec                              ];    sizeof      Returns the bytes in the structure, or the member if                you pass it an argument, such as                        &amp;rusage sizeof(&amp;rusage ru_utime)    typedef     This is the perl format definition for passing to pack and                unpack.  If you ask for the typedef of a nothing, you get                the whole structure, otherwise you get that of the member                you ask for.  Padding is taken care of, as is the magic to                guarantee that a union is unpacked into all its aliases.                Bitfields are not quite yet supported however.    offsetof    This function is the byte offset into the array of that                member.  You may wish to use this for indexing directly                into the packed structure with vec() if you re too lazy                to unpack it.    typeof      Not to be confused with the typedef accessor function, this                one returns the C type of that field.  This would allow                you to print out a nice structured pretty print of some                structure without knoning anything about it beforehand.                No args to this one is a noop.  Someday I ll post such                a thing to dump out your u structure for you.The way I see this being used is like basically this:        % h2ph &lt;some_include_file.h  &gt;  /usr/lib/perl/tmp.ph        % c2ph  some_include_file.h  &gt;&gt; /usr/lib/perl/tmp.ph        % installIt s a little tricker with c2ph because you have to get the includesright.

If only a  working  fileis  given, ci tries to find the corresponding RCS file in an RCS subdi-rectory and then in the working file s directory.   For  more  details,see FILE NAMING below.For  ci  to work, the caller s login must be on the access list, exceptif the access list is empty or the caller is the superuser or the ownerof  the  file.  To append a new revision to an existing branch, the tiprevision on that branch must be locked by the caller.  Otherwise,  onlya  new branch can be created.

A  lockheld by someone else can be broken with the rcs command.Unless  the  -f  option  is given, ci checks whether the revision to bedeposited differs from the preceding one.  If not, instead of  creatinga new revision ci reverts to the preceding one.  To revert, ordinary ciremoves the working file and any lock; ci -l keeps  and  ci -u  removesany  lock,  and  then  they both generate a new working file much as ifco -l or co -u had  been  applied  to  the  preceding  revision.   Whenreverting, any -n and -s options apply to the preceding revision.For  each  revision  deposited,  ci prompts for a log message.  The logmessage should summarize the change and must be terminated  by  end-of-file or by a line containing . by itself.  If several files are checkedin ci asks whether to reuse the previous log message.  If the  standardinput is not a terminal, ci suppresses the prompt and uses the same logmessage for all files.  See also -m.If the RCS file does not exist, ci creates it and deposits the contentsof the working file as the initial revision (default number: 1.1).  Theaccess list is initialized to empty.

It is called a macro processor because it allows you todefine macros, which are brief abbreviations for longer constructs.The C preprocessor is intended to be used only with C, C++, andObjective-C source code.  In the past, it has been abused as a generaltext processor.  It will choke on input which does not obey C s lexicalrules.  For example, apostrophes will be interpreted as the beginningof character constants, and cause errors.  Also, you cannot rely on itpreserving characteristics of the input which are not significant toC-family languages.  If a Makefile is preprocessed, all the hard tabswill be removed, and the Makefile will not work.Having said that, you can often get away with using cpp on things whichare not C.  Other Algol-ish programming languages are often safe(Pascal, Ada, etc.) So is assembly, with caution.  -traditional-cppmode preserves more white space, and is otherwise more permissive.Many of the problems can be avoided by writing C or C++ style commentsinstead of native language comments, and keeping macros simple.Wherever possible, you should use a preprocessor geared to the languageyou are writing in.  Modern versions of the GNU assembler have macrofacilities.  Most high level programming languages have their ownconditional compilation and inclusion mechanism.  If all else fails,try a true general text processor, such as GNU M4.C preprocessors vary in some details.  This manual discusses the GNU Cpreprocessor, which provides a small superset of the features of ISOStandard C.  In its default mode, the GNU C preprocessor does not do afew things required by the standard.  These are features which arerarely, if ever, used, and may cause surprising changes to the meaningof a program which does not expect them.  To get strict ISO Standard C,you should use the -std=c89 or -std=c99 options, depending on whichversion of the standard you want.  To get all the mandatorydiagnostics, you must also use -pedantic.This manual describes the behavior of the ISO preprocessor.  Toinput files is written in outfile.Either infile or outfile may be -, which as infile means to read fromstandard input and as outfile means to write to standard output.  Also,if either file is omitted, it means the same as if - had been specifiedfor that file.Unless otherwise noted, or the option ends in =, all options which takean argument may have that argument appear either immediately after theoption, or with a space between option and argument: -Ifoo and -I foohave the same effect.Many options have multi-letter names; therefore multiple single-letteroptions may not be grouped: -dM is very different from -d -M.-D name    Predefine name as a macro, with definition 1.-D name=definition    The contents of definition are tokenized and processed as if they    appeared during translation phase three in a #define directive.  In    particular, the definition will be truncated by embedded newline    characters.    If you are invoking the preprocessor from a shell or shell-like    program you may need to use the shell s quoting syntax to protect    characters such as spaces that have a meaning in the shell syntax.    If you wish to define a function-like macro on the command line,    write its argument list with surrounding parentheses before the    equals sign (if any).  Parentheses are meaningful to most shells,    so you will need to quote the option.  With sh and csh,    -D name(args...)=definition  works.    -D and -U options are processed in the order they are given on the    command line.  All -imacros file and -include file options are    processed after all -D and -U options.-U name    Cancel any previous definition of name, either built in or provided    with a -D option.-undef    Do not predefine any system-specific or GCC-specific macros.  The    standard predefined macros remain defined.-I dir    Add the directory dir to the list of directories to be searched for    header files.    Directories named by -I are searched before the standard system    include directories.  If the directory dir is a standard system    include directory, the option is ignored to ensure that the default    search order for system directories and the special treatment of    expressions.  Note that many of the preprocessor s warnings are on    by default and have no options to control them.-Wcomment-Wcomments    Warn whenever a comment-start sequence /* appears in a /* comment,    or whenever a backslash-newline appears in a // comment.  (Both    forms have the same effect.)-Wtrigraphs    @anchor{Wtrigraphs} Most trigraphs in comments cannot affect the    meaning of the program.  However, a trigraph that would form an    escaped newline (??/ at the end of a line) can, by changing where    the comment begins or ends.  Therefore, only trigraphs that would    form escaped newlines produce warnings inside a comment.    This option is implied by -Wall.  If -Wall is not given, this    option is still enabled unless trigraphs are enabled.  To get    trigraph conversion without warnings, but get the other -Wall    warnings, use -trigraphs -Wall -Wno-trigraphs.-Wtraditional    Warn about certain constructs that behave differently in    traditional and ISO C.  Also warn about ISO C constructs that have    no traditional C equivalent, and problematic constructs which    should be avoided.-Wimport    Warn the first time #import is used.-Wundef    Warn whenever an identifier which is not a macro is encountered in    an #if directive, outside of defined.  Such identifiers are    replaced with zero.-Wunused-macros    Warn about macros defined in the main file that are unused.  A    macro is used if it is expanded or tested for existence at least    once.  The preprocessor will also warn if the macro has not been    used at the time it is redefined or undefined.    Built-in macros, macros defined on the command line, and macros    defined in include files are not warned about.    Note: If a macro is actually used, but only used in skipped    conditional blocks, then CPP will report it as unused.  To avoid    the warning in such a case, you might improve the scope of the    macro s definition by, for example, moving it into the first    skipped block.  Alternatively, you could provide a dummy use with    something like:            #if defined the_macro_causing_the_warning            #endif-Werror    Make all warnings into hard errors.  Source code which triggers    warnings will be rejected.-Wsystem-headers    Issue warnings for code in system headers.  These are normally    unhelpful in finding bugs in your own code, therefore suppressed.    If you are responsible for the system library, you may want to see    them.-w  Suppress all warnings, including those which GNU CPP issues by    default.-pedantic    Issue all the mandatory diagnostics listed in the C standard.  Some    of them are left out by default, since they trigger frequently on    harmless code.-pedantic-errors    Issue all the mandatory diagnostics, and make all mandatory    diagnostics into errors.  This includes mandatory diagnostics that    GCC issues without -pedantic but treats as warnings.-M  Instead of outputting the result of preprocessing, output a rule    suitable for make describing the dependencies of the main source    file.  The preprocessor outputs one make rule containing the object    file name for that source file, a colon, and the names of all the    included files, including those coming from -include or -imacros    command line options.    Unless specified explicitly (with -MT or -MQ), the object file name    consists of the basename of the source file with any suffix    replaced with object file suffix.  If there are many included files    then the rule is split into several lines using \\-newline.  The    rule has no commands.    This option does not suppress the preprocessor s debug output, such    as -dM.  To avoid mixing such debug output with the dependency    rules you should explicitly specify the dependency output file with    -MF, or use an environment variable like DEPENDENCIES_OUTPUT.    Debug output will still be sent to the regular output stream as    normal.    Passing -M to the driver implies -E, and suppresses warnings with    an implicit -w.-MM Like -M but do not mention header files that are found in system    header directories, nor header files that are included, directly or    indirectly, from such a header.    This implies that the choice of angle brackets or double quotes in    an #include directive does not in itself determine whether that    header will appear in -MM dependency output.  This is a slight-MG In conjunction with an option such as -M requesting dependency    generation, -MG assumes missing header files are generated files    and adds them to the dependency list without raising an error.  The    dependency filename is taken directly from the  #include  directive    without prepending any path.  -MG also suppresses preprocessed    output, as a missing header file renders this useless.    This feature is used in automatic updating of makefiles.-MP This option instructs CPP to add a phony target for each dependency    other than the main file, causing each to depend on nothing.  These    dummy rules work around errors make gives if you remove header    files without updating the Makefile to match.    This is typical output:            test.o: test.c test.h            test.h:-MT target    Change the target of the rule emitted by dependency generation.  By    default CPP takes the name of the main input file, including any    path, deletes any file suffix such as .c, and appends the    platform s usual object suffix.  The result is the target.    An -MT option will set the target to be exactly the string you    specify.  If you want multiple targets, you can specify them as a    single argument to -MT, or use multiple -MT options.    For example, -MT  $(objpfx)foo.o  might give            $(objpfx)foo.o: foo.c-MQ target    Same as -MT, but it quotes any characters which are special to    Make.  -MQ  $(objpfx)foo.o  gives            $$(objpfx)foo.o: foo.c    The default target is automatically quoted, as if it were given    with -MQ.-MD -MD is equivalent to -M -MF file, except that -E is not implied.    The driver determines file based on whether an -o option is given.    If it is, the driver uses its argument but with a suffix of .d,    otherwise it take the basename of the input file and applies a .d    suffix.    If -MD is used in conjunction with -E, any -o switch is understood    to specify the dependency output file (but @pxref{dashMF,,-MF}),    but if used without -E, each -o is understood to specify a target    object file.    This has nothing to do with standards conformance or extensions; it    merely selects which base syntax to expect.  If you give none of    these options, cpp will deduce the language from the extension of    the source file: .c, .cc, .m, or .S.  Some other common extensions    for C++ and assembly are also recognized.  If cpp does not    recognize the extension, it will treat the file as C; this is the    most generic mode.    Note: Previous versions of cpp accepted a -lang option which    selected both the language and the standards conformance level.    This option has been removed, because it conflicts with the -l    option.-std=standard-ansi    Specify the standard to which the code should conform.  Currently    CPP knows about C and C++ standards; others may be added in the    future.    standard may be one of:     iso9899:1990      c89         The ISO C standard from 1990.  c89 is the customary shorthand        for this version of the standard.        The -ansi option is equivalent to -std=c89.     iso9899:199409         The 1990 C standard, as amended in 1994.     iso9899:1999      c99      iso9899:199x      c9x         The revised ISO C standard, published in December 1999.  Before        publication, this was known as C9X.     gnu89         The 1990 C standard plus GNU extensions.  This is the default.     gnu99      gnu9x         The 1999 C standard plus GNU extensions.     c++98         The 1998 ISO C++ standard plus amendments.     gnu++98         The same as -std=c++98 plus GNU extensions.  This is the        default for C++ code.-I- Split the include path.  Any directories specified with -I options    before -I- are searched only for headers requested with    directory of the current file, if appropriate) are searched.-nostdinc++    Do not search for header files in the C++-specific standard    directories, but do still search the other standard directories.    (This option is used when building the C++ library.)-include file    Process file as if  #include  file   appeared as the first line of    the primary source file.  However, the first directory searched for    file is the preprocessor s working directory instead of the    directory containing the main source file.  If not found there, it    is searched for in the remainder of the  #include  ...   search    chain as normal.    If multiple -include options are given, the files are included in    the order they appear on the command line.-imacros file    Exactly like -include, except that any output produced by scanning    file is thrown away.  Macros it defines remain defined.  This    allows you to acquire all the macros from a header without also    processing its declarations.    All files specified by -imacros are processed before all files    specified by -include.-idirafter dir    Search dir for header files, but do it after all directories    specified with -I and the standard system directories have been    exhausted.  dir is treated as a system include directory.-iprefix prefix    Specify prefix as the prefix for subsequent -iwithprefix options.    If the prefix represents a directory, you should include the final    /.-iwithprefix dir-iwithprefixbefore dir    Append dir to the prefix specified previously with -iprefix, and    add the resulting directory to the include search path.    -iwithprefixbefore puts it in the same place -I would; -iwithprefix    puts it where -idirafter would.-isysroot dir    This option is like the --sysroot option, but applies only to    header files.  See the --sysroot option for more information.-imultilib dir    Use dir as a subdirectory of the directory containing target-    specific C++ headers.-isystem dir    Search dir for header files, after all directories specified by -I-fextended-identifiers    Accept universal character names in identifiers.  This option is    experimental; in a future version of GCC, it will be enabled by    default for C99 and C++.-fpreprocessed    Indicate to the preprocessor that the input file has already been    preprocessed.  This suppresses things like macro expansion,    trigraph conversion, escaped newline splicing, and processing of    most directives.  The preprocessor still recognizes and removes    comments, so that you can pass a file preprocessed with -C to the    compiler without problems.  In this mode the integrated    preprocessor is little more than a tokenizer for the front ends.    -fpreprocessed is implicit if the input file has one of the    extensions .i, .ii or .mi.  These are the extensions that GCC uses    for preprocessed files created by -save-temps.-ftabstop=width    Set the distance between tab stops.  This helps the preprocessor    report correct column numbers in warnings or errors, even if tabs    appear on the line.  If the value is less than 1 or greater than    100, the option is ignored.  The default is 8.-fexec-charset=charset    Set the execution character set, used for string and character    constants.  The default is UTF-8.  charset can be any encoding    supported by the system s  iconv  library routine.-fwide-exec-charset=charset    Set the wide execution character set, used for wide string and    character constants.  The default is UTF-32 or UTF-16, whichever    corresponds to the width of  wchar_t .  As with -fexec-charset,    charset can be any encoding supported by the system s  iconv     library routine; however, you will have problems with encodings    that do not fit exactly in  wchar_t .-finput-charset=charset    Set the input character set, used for translation from the    character set of the input file to the source character set used by    GCC.  If the locale does not specify, or GCC cannot get this    information from the locale, the default is UTF-8.  This can be    overridden by either the locale or this command line option.    Currently the command line option takes precedence if there s a    conflict.  charset can be any encoding supported by the system s     iconv  library routine.-fworking-directory    Enable generation of linemarkers in the preprocessor output that    will let the compiler know the current working directory at the    time of preprocessing.  When this option is enabled, the    preprocessor will emit, after the initial linemarker, a second    linemarker with the current working directory followed by two    slashes.  GCC will use this directory, when it s present in the-A predicate=answer    Make an assertion with the predicate predicate and answer answer.    This form is preferred to the older form -A predicate(answer),    which is still supported, because it does not use shell special    characters.-A -predicate=answer    Cancel an assertion with the predicate predicate and answer answer.-dCHARS    CHARS is a sequence of one or more of the following characters, and    must not be preceded by a space.  Other characters are interpreted    by the compiler proper, or reserved for future versions of GCC, and    so are silently ignored.  If you specify characters whose behavior    conflicts, the result is undefined.    M   Instead of the normal output, generate a list of #define        directives for all the macros defined during the execution of        the preprocessor, including predefined macros.  This gives you        a way of finding out what is predefined in your version of the        preprocessor.  Assuming you have no file foo.h, the command                touch foo.h; cpp -dM foo.h        will show all the predefined macros.    D   Like M except in two respects: it does not include the        predefined macros, and it outputs both the #define directives        and the result of preprocessing.  Both kinds of output go to        the standard output file.    N   Like D, but emit only the macro names, not their expansions.    I   Output #include directives in addition to the result of        preprocessing.-P  Inhibit generation of linemarkers in the output from the    preprocessor.  This might be useful when running the preprocessor    on something that is not C code, and will be sent to a program    which might be confused by the linemarkers.-C  Do not discard comments.  All comments are passed through to the    output file, except for comments in processed directives, which are    deleted along with the directive.    You should be prepared for side effects when using -C; it causes    the preprocessor to treat comments as tokens in their own right.    For example, comments appearing at the start of what would be a    directive line have the effect of turning that line into an    ordinary source line, since the first token on the line is no    longer a #.-CC Do not discard comments, including during macro expansion.  This is    like -C, except that comments contained within macros are also-trigraphs    Process trigraph sequences.-remap    Enable special code to work around file systems which only permit    very short file names, such as MS-DOS.--help--target-help    Print text describing all the command line options instead of    preprocessing anything.-v  Verbose mode.  Print out GNU CPP s version number at the beginning    of execution, and report the final form of the include path.-H  Print the name of each header file used, in addition to other    normal activities.  Each name is indented to show how deep in the    #include stack it is.  Precompiled header files are also printed,    even if they are found to be invalid; an invalid precompiled header    file is printed with ...x and a valid one with ...! .-version--version    Print out GNU CPP s version number.  With one dash, proceed to    preprocess as normal.  With two dashes, exit immediately.');
INSERT INTO network_lab.Links (id, link, occurence, tags) VALUES (209, '/man1/cpp', 1, 'The C preprocessor, often known as cpp, is a macro processor that isused automatically by the C compiler to transform your program beforecompilation.  It is called a macro processor because it allows you todefine macros, which are brief abbreviations for longer constructs.The C preprocessor is intended to be used only with C, C++, andObjective-C source code.  In the past, it has been abused as a generaltext processor.  It will choke on input which does not obey C s lexicalrules.  For example, apostrophes will be interpreted as the beginningof character constants, and cause errors.  Also, you cannot rely on itpreserving characteristics of the input which are not significant toC-family languages.  If a Makefile is preprocessed, all the hard tabswill be removed, and the Makefile will not work.Having said that, you can often get away with using cpp on things whichare not C.  Other Algol-ish programming languages are often safe(Pascal, Ada, etc.) So is assembly, with caution.  -traditional-cppmode preserves more white space, and is otherwise more permissive.Many of the problems can be avoided by writing C or C++ style commentsinstead of native language comments, and keeping macros simple.Wherever possible, you should use a preprocessor geared to the languageyou are writing in.

Directories named by -I are searched before the standard system    include directories.  If the directory dir is a standard system    include directory, the option is ignored to ensure that the default    search order for system directories and the special treatment of    At present this is -Wcomment, -Wtrigraphs, -Wmultichar and a    warning about integer promotion causing a change of sign in  #if     expressions.  Note that many of the preprocessor s warnings are on    by default and have no options to control them.-Wcomment-Wcomments    Warn whenever a comment-start sequence /* appears in a /* comment,    or whenever a backslash-newline appears in a // comment.  (Both    forms have the same effect.)-Wtrigraphs    Most trigraphs in comments cannot affect the meaning of the    program.  However, a trigraph that would form an escaped newline    (??/ at the end of a line) can, by changing where the comment    begins or ends.  Therefore, only trigraphs that would form escaped    newlines produce warnings inside a comment.    This option is implied by -Wall.  If -Wall is not given, this    option is still enabled unless trigraphs are enabled.  To get    trigraph conversion without warnings, but get the other -Wall    warnings, use -trigraphs -Wall -Wno-trigraphs.-Wtraditional    Warn about certain constructs that behave differently in    traditional and ISO C.

Passing -M to the driver implies -E, and suppresses warnings with    an implicit -w.-MM Like -M but do not mention header files that are found in system    header directories, nor header files that are included, directly or    indirectly, from such a header.    This implies that the choice of angle brackets or double quotes in    an #include directive does not in itself determine whether that    header will appear in -MM dependency output.  This is a slight    change in semantics from GCC versions 3.0 and earlier.    dependency filename is taken directly from the  #include  directive    without prepending any path.  -MG also suppresses preprocessed    output, as a missing header file renders this useless.    This feature is used in automatic updating of makefiles.-MP This option instructs CPP to add a phony target for each dependency    other than the main file, causing each to depend on nothing.

The driver determines file based on whether an -o option is given.    If it is, the driver uses its argument but with a suffix of .d,    otherwise it takes the name of the input file, removes any    directory components and suffix, and applies a .d suffix.    If -MD is used in conjunction with -E, any -o switch is understood    to specify the dependency output file, but if used without -E, each    -o is understood to specify a target object file.    Since -E is not implied, -MD can be used to generate a dependency    output file as a side-effect of the compilation process.-MMD    for C++ and assembly are also recognized.  If cpp does not    recognize the extension, it will treat the file as C; this is the    most generic mode.    Note: Previous versions of cpp accepted a -lang option which    selected both the language and the standards conformance level.    This option has been removed, because it conflicts with the -l    option.-std=standard-ansi    Specify the standard to which the code should conform.  Currently    CPP knows about C and C++ standards; others may be added in the    future.    standard may be one of:     c90      c89      iso9899:1990         The ISO C standard from 1990.  c90 is the customary shorthand        for this version of the standard.        The -ansi option is equivalent to -std=c90.     iso9899:199409         The 1990 C standard, as amended in 1994.     iso9899:1999      c99      iso9899:199x      c9x         The revised ISO C standard, published in December 1999.  Before        publication, this was known as C9X.     c1x         The next version of the ISO C standard, still under        development.     gnu90      gnu89         The 1990 C standard plus GNU extensions.  This is the default.     gnu99      gnu9x         The 1999 C standard plus GNU extensions.     gnu1x         The next version of the ISO C standard, still under        development, plus GNU extensions.     c++98         The 1998 ISO C++ standard plus amendments.    This option has been deprecated.-nostdinc    Do not search the standard system directories for header files.    Only the directories you have specified with -I options (and the    directory of the current file, if appropriate) are searched.-nostdinc++    Do not search for header files in the C++-specific standard    directories, but do still search the other standard directories.    (This option is used when building the C++ library.)-include file    Process file as if  #include  file   appeared as the first line of    the primary source file.  However, the first directory searched for    file is the preprocessor s working directory instead of the    directory containing the main source file.  If not found there, it    is searched for in the remainder of the  #include  ...   search    chain as normal.    If multiple -include options are given, the files are included in    the order they appear on the command line.-imacros file    Exactly like -include, except that any output produced by scanning    file is thrown away.  Macros it defines remain defined.  This    allows you to acquire all the macros from a header without also    processing its declarations.    All files specified by -imacros are processed before all files    specified by -include.-idirafter dir    Search dir for header files, but do it after all directories    specified with -I and the standard system directories have been    exhausted.  dir is treated as a system include directory.  If dir    begins with  = , then the  =  will be replaced by the sysroot    prefix; see --sysroot and -isysroot.-iprefix prefix    Specify prefix as the prefix for subsequent -iwithprefix options.    If the prefix represents a directory, you should include the final    /.-iwithprefix dir-iwithprefixbefore dir    Append dir to the prefix specified previously with -iprefix, and    add the resulting directory to the include search path.    -iwithprefixbefore puts it in the same place -I would; -iwithprefix    puts it where -idirafter would.-isysroot dir    This option is like the --sysroot option, but applies only to    to the standard system directories.    If dir begins with  = , then the  =  will be replaced by the    sysroot prefix; see --sysroot and -isysroot.-iquote dir    Search dir only for header files requested with  #include  file  ;    they are not searched for  #include &lt;file&gt; , before all directories    specified by -I and before the standard system directories.    If dir begins with  = , then the  =  will be replaced by the    sysroot prefix; see --sysroot and -isysroot.-fdirectives-only    When preprocessing, handle directives, but do not expand macros.    The option s behavior depends on the -E and -fpreprocessed options.    With -E, preprocessing is limited to the handling of directives    such as  #define ,  #ifdef , and  #error .  Other preprocessor    operations, such as macro expansion and trigraph conversion are not    performed.  In addition, the -dD option is implicitly enabled.    With -fpreprocessed, predefinition of command line and most builtin    macros is disabled.  Macros such as  __LINE__ , which are    contextually dependent, are handled normally.  This enables    compilation of files previously preprocessed with  -E    -fdirectives-only .    With both -E and -fpreprocessed, the rules for -fpreprocessed take    precedence.  This enables full preprocessing of files previously    preprocessed with  -E -fdirectives-only .-fdollars-in-identifiers    Accept $ in identifiers.-fextended-identifiers    Accept universal character names in identifiers.  This option is    experimental; in a future version of GCC, it will be enabled by    default for C99 and C++.-fpreprocessed    Indicate to the preprocessor that the input file has already been    preprocessed.  This suppresses things like macro expansion,    trigraph conversion, escaped newline splicing, and processing of    most directives.  The preprocessor still recognizes and removes    comments, so that you can pass a file preprocessed with -C to the    compiler without problems.  In this mode the integrated    preprocessor is little more than a tokenizer for the front ends.    -fpreprocessed is implicit if the input file has one of the    extensions .i, .ii or .mi.  These are the extensions that GCC uses    for preprocessed files created by -save-temps.    Set the wide execution character set, used for wide string and    character constants.  The default is UTF-32 or UTF-16, whichever    corresponds to the width of  wchar_t .  As with -fexec-charset,    charset can be any encoding supported by the system s  iconv     library routine; however, you will have problems with encodings    that do not fit exactly in  wchar_t .-finput-charset=charset    Set the input character set, used for translation from the    character set of the input file to the source character set used by    GCC.  If the locale does not specify, or GCC cannot get this    information from the locale, the default is UTF-8.  This can be    overridden by either the locale or this command line option.    Currently the command line option takes precedence if there s a    conflict.  charset can be any encoding supported by the system s     iconv  library routine.-fworking-directory    Enable generation of linemarkers in the preprocessor output that    will let the compiler know the current working directory at the    time of preprocessing.  When this option is enabled, the    preprocessor will emit, after the initial linemarker, a second    linemarker with the current working directory followed by two    slashes.  GCC will use this directory, when it s present in the    preprocessed input, as the directory emitted as the current working    directory in some debugging information formats.  This option is    implicitly enabled if debugging information is enabled, but this    can be inhibited with the negated form -fno-working-directory.  If    the -P flag is present in the command line, this option has no    effect, since no  #line  directives are emitted whatsoever.-fno-show-column    Do not print column numbers in diagnostics.  This may be necessary    if diagnostics are being scanned by a program that does not    understand the column numbers, such as dejagnu.-A predicate=answer    Make an assertion with the predicate predicate and answer answer.    This form is preferred to the older form -A predicate(answer),    which is still supported, because it does not use shell special    characters.-A -predicate=answer    Cancel an assertion with the predicate predicate and answer answer.-dCHARS    CHARS is a sequence of one or more of the following characters, and    must not be preceded by a space.  Other characters are interpreted    by the compiler proper, or reserved for future versions of GCC, and    so are silently ignored.  If you specify characters whose behavior    conflicts, the result is undefined.    M   Instead of the normal output, generate a list of #define        directives for all the macros defined during the execution of        predefined macros, and it outputs both the #define directives        and the result of preprocessing.  Both kinds of output go to        the standard output file.    N   Like D, but emit only the macro names, not their expansions.    I   Output #include directives in addition to the result of        preprocessing.    U   Like D except that only macros that are expanded, or whose        definedness is tested in preprocessor directives, are output;        the output is delayed until the use or test of the macro; and        #undef directives are also output for macros tested but        undefined at the time.-P  Inhibit generation of linemarkers in the output from the    preprocessor.  This might be useful when running the preprocessor    on something that is not C code, and will be sent to a program    which might be confused by the linemarkers.-C  Do not discard comments.  All comments are passed through to the    output file, except for comments in processed directives, which are    deleted along with the directive.    You should be prepared for side effects when using -C; it causes    the preprocessor to treat comments as tokens in their own right.    For example, comments appearing at the start of what would be a    directive line have the effect of turning that line into an    ordinary source line, since the first token on the line is no    longer a #.-CC Do not discard comments, including during macro expansion.  This is    like -C, except that comments contained within macros are also    passed through to the output file where the macro is expanded.    In addition to the side-effects of the -C option, the -CC option    causes all C++-style comments inside a macro to be converted to    C-style comments.  This is to prevent later use of that macro from    inadvertently commenting out the remainder of the source line.    The -CC option is generally used to support lint comments.-traditional-cpp    Try to imitate the behavior of old-fashioned C preprocessors, as    opposed to ISO C preprocessors.-trigraphs    Process trigraph sequences.-remap    Enable special code to work around file systems which only permit    very short file names, such as MS-DOS.--help-version--version    Print out GNU CPP s version number.  With one dash, proceed to    preprocess as normal.  With two dashes, exit immediately.');

If you are running Perl 5.005 and did compile it for threads, then    the server will create a new thread for each connection. The thread    will execute the server s Run() method and then terminate. This    mode is the default, you can force it with  --mode=threads .    If threads are not available, but you have a working fork(), then    the server will behave similar by creating a new process for each    connection.  This mode will be used automatically in the absence of    threads or if you use the  --mode=fork  option.    Finally there s a single-connection mode: If the server has    accepted a connection, he will enter the Run() method. No other    connections are accepted until the Run() method returns (if the    client disconnects).  This operation mode is useful if you have    neither threads nor fork(), for example on the Macintosh. For    debugging purposes you can force this mode with  --mode=single .--pidfile=file    (UNIX only) If this option is present, a PID file will be created    at the given location. Default is to not create a pidfile.--user=uid    After doing a bind(), change the real and effective UID to the    given.  This is useful, if you want your server to bind to a    privileged port (&lt;1024), but don t want the server to execute as    root. See also the --group and the --chroot options.

If an entry is appended to the current ver-sion s entries, and the maintainer is different from the maintainer whois listed as having done the previous entries, then lines will be addedto the changelog to tell which maintainers  made  which  changes.  Cur-rently  only  one of the several such styles of recording this informa-tion is supported, in which the name of the maintainer who made  a  setof  changes  appears on a line before the changes, inside square brack-ets.

If an entry is appended to the current ver-sion s entries, and the maintainer is different from the maintainer whois listed as having done the previous entries, then lines will be addedto the changelog to tell which maintainers  made  which  changes.

In this case dlltool will scan theobject files specified on its command line looking for those functionswhich have been specially marked as being exported and put entries forthem in the .def file it creates.In order to mark a function as being exported from a DLL, it needs tohave an -export:&lt;name_of_function&gt; entry in the .drectve section of theobject file.  This can be done in C by using the asm() operator:          asm ( .section .drectve );          asm ( .ascii \\ -export:my_func\\  );dlltool when it is creating or reading in a .def file.If the -y option is specified, dlltool generates a delay-import librarythat can be used instead of the normal import library to allow aprogram to link to the dll only as soon as an imported function iscalled for the first time. The resulting executable will need to belinked to the static delayimp library containing __delayLoadHelper2(),which in turn will import LoadLibraryA and GetProcAddress fromkernel32.dlltool builds the library file by hand, but it builds the exports fileby creating temporary files containing assembler statements and thenassembling these.  The -S command line option can be used to specifythe path to the assembler that dlltool will use, and the -f option canbe used to pass specific flags to that assembler.  The -n can be usedto prevent dlltool from deleting these temporary assembler files whenit is done, and if -n is specified twice then this will prevent dlltoolfrom deleting the temporary object files it used to build the library.Here is an example of creating a DLL from a source file dll.c and alsocreating a program (from an object file called program.o) that usesthat DLL:          gcc -c dll.c          dlltool -e exports.o -l dll.lib dll.o          gcc dll.o exports.o -o dll.dll          gcc program.o dll.lib -o programdlltool may also be used to query an existing import library todetermine the name of the DLL to which it is associated.  See thedescription of the -I or --identify option.');

The amount of context is  subject  to  a  system-imposedlimit.If  the  -V  flag  is  given, characters that are not in the 7-bit ANSIprintable character set will always be displayed in the style  of   cat-v ,  even if ispell thinks that these characters are legal ISO Latin-1on your system.

Normal  mode, as well as the -l, -a, and -A  options  and  interactivemode  (see below) also accepts the following  common  flags on the com-mand line:       -t     The input file is in TeX or LaTeX format.       -n     The input file is in nroff/troff format.       -H     The input file is  in  SGML/HTML  format.   (This  should              really  be  -s,  but for historical reasons that flag was              already taken.)       -o     The input file should be treated as ordinary text.

(The  default mode is controlled by the DEFTEXFLAG installationoption, but is  normally  nroff/troff  mode  for  historical  reasons.)Unless overridden by one of the mode-selection switches, TeX/LaTeX modeis automatically selected if an input file has  the  extension   .tex ,and HTML mode is automatically selected if an input file has the exten-sion  .html  or  .htm .In HTML mode, HTML tags delimited by &lt;&gt; signs are skipped, except  thatthe   ALT=  construct is recognized if it appears with no spaces aroundthe equals sign, and the text inside is spell-checked.In TeX/LaTeX mode, whenever a backslash ( \\ )  is  found,  ispell  willskip  to  the next whitespace or TeX/LaTeX delimiter.  Certain commandscontain arguments which should not be checked, such as labels and  ref-erence keys as are found in the \\cite command, since they contain arbi-trary, non-word arguments.  Spell checking is also suppressed  when  inmath mode.  Thus, for example, given       \\chapter {This is a Ckapter} \\cite{SCH86}ispell  will find  Ckapter  but not  SCH .  The -t option does not rec-ognize the TeX comment character   % ,  so  comments  are  also  spell-checked.   It  also  assumes correct LaTeX syntax.  Arguments to infre-quently used commands and some optional arguments are sometimes checkedunnecessarily.  The bibliography will not be checked if ispell was com-piled with IGNOREBIB defined.   Otherwise,  the  bibliography  will  bechecked but the reference key will not.References for the tib (if available on your system), bibliography sys-tem, that is, text between a ``[.   or ``&lt;.   and ``.]   or ``.&gt;   willalways be ignored in TeX/LaTeX mode.The  -b  and  -x  options control whether ispell leaves a backup (.bak)file for each input file.  The .bak  file  contains  the  pre-correctedtext.  If there are file opening / writing errors, the .bak file may beleft for recovery purposes even with the -x option.   The  default  forthis option is controlled by the DEFNOBACKUPFLAG installation option.installation the default may vary depending  on  which  dictionary  youchoose.The  -P and -m options control when ispell automatically generates sug-gested root/affix combinations for possible addition to  your  personaldictionary.   (These are the entries in the  guess  list which are pre-ceded by question marks.)  If -P is specified, such  guesses  are  dis-played  only if ispell cannot generate any possibilities that match thecurrent dictionary.  If -m is specified, such guesses are  always  dis-played.   This can be useful if the dictionary has a limited word list,or a word list with few suffixes.  However, you should be careful  whenusing  this  option,  as  it  can generate guesses that produce illegalwords.  The default for this option is  controlled  by  the  dictionaryfile used.The  -S  option suppresses ispell s normal behavior of sorting the listof possible replacement words.  Some people may prefer this,  since  itsomewhat  enhances  the  probability that the correct word will be low-numbered.The -d option is used to specify an alternate hashed  dictionary  file,other  than  the  default.  If the filename does not contain a  / , thelibrary directory for the default dictionary file is prefixed; thus, touse  a  dictionary in the local directory  -d ./xxx.hash  must be used.This is useful to allow dictionaries for alternate  languages.   Unlikeprevious  versions  of  ispell,  a  dictionary of /dev/null is illegal,because the dictionary contains the affix table.  If you need an effec-tively  empty  dictionary,  create  a  one-entry  list with an unlikelystring (e.g.,  qqqqq ).The -p option is used to specify an alternate personal dictionary file.If the file name does not begin with  / , $HOME is prefixed.  Also, theshell variable WORDLIST may be set, which renames the personal  dictio-nary  in the same manner.  The command line overrides any WORDLIST set-ting.  If neither the -p switch nor the WORDLIST  environment  variableis given, ispell will search for a personal dictionary in both the cur-rent directory and $HOME, creating one in $HOME if none is found.   Thepreferred  name is constructed by appending  .ispell_  to the base nameof the hash file.  For example, if you use the English dictionary, yourpersonal  dictionary would be named  .ispell_english .  However, if thefile  .ispell_words  exists, it will be used as the personal dictionaryregardless  of the language hash file chosen.  This feature is includedprimarily for backwards compatibility.If the -p option is not specified, ispell will look for  personal  dic-tionaries  in  both  the  current directory and the home directory.  Ifdictionaries exist in both places, they will be merged.  If  any  wordsare  added to the personal dictionary, they will be written to the cur-rent directory if a dictionary already existed in that place; otherwisethey will be written to the dictionary in the home directory.The  -w option may be used to specify characters other than alphabeticswhich may also appear in words.  For instance, -w  &amp;  will allow  AT&amp;T to  be  picked up.  Underscores are useful in many technical documents.characters.  Use of  n  does not conflict with anything because  actualalphabetics have no meaning - alphabetics are already accepted.  Ispellwill typically be used with input from a file, meaning that  preservingparity for possible 8 bit characters from the input text is OK.  If youspecify the -l option, and actually type text from the  terminal,  thismay create problems if your stty settings preserve parity.It  is  not possible to use -w with certain characters.  In particular,the flag-marker character for the language (defined in the affix  file,but usually  / ) can never be made into a word character.The  -W  option  may  be used to change the length of words that ispellalways accepts as legal.  Normally, ispell will accept all  1-characterwords as legal, which is equivalent to specifying  -W 1.   (The defaultfor this switch is actually  controlled  by  the  MINWORD  installationoption, so it may vary at your installation.)  If you want all words tobe checked against the dictionary, regardless of length, you might wantto specify  -W 0.   On the other hand, if your document specifies a lotof three-letter acronyms, you would specify  -W 3  to accept all  wordsof  three  letters  or less.  Regardless of the setting of this option,ispell will only generate words that are in the dictionary as suggestedreplacements  for words; this prevents the list from becoming too long.Obviously, this option can be very dangerous, since short  misspellingsmay  be missed.  If you use this option a lot, you should probably makea last pass without it before you publish  your  document,  to  protectyourself against errors.The  -T  option  is used to specify a default formatter type for use ingenerating string characters.  This switch overrides the  default  typedetermined  from the file name.  The type argument may be either one ofthe unique names defined in the language affix file (e.g., nroff) or  afile  suffix  including  the dot (e.g., .tex).  If no -T option appearsand no type can be determined from the file name,  the  default  stringcharacter type declared in the language affix file will be used.The  -k option is used to enhance the behavior of certain deformatters.The name parameter gives the name of a  deformatter  keyword  set  (seebelow),  and  the  list  parameter gives a list of one or more keywordsthat are to be treated specially.  If list begins with a plus (+) sign,it  is added to the existing keywords; otherwise it replaces the exist-ing keyword list.   For  example,  -ktexskip1  +bibliographystyle  adds bibliographystyle    to   the  TeX  skip-1  list,  while  -khtmlignorepre,strong replaces the HTML ignore list with  pre  and  strong .   Thelists available are:texskip1       TeX/LaTeX  commands  that take a single argument that should not       be spell-checked, such as  bibliographystyle .  The  default  is        end ,   vspace ,   hspace ,   cite ,   ref ,  parbox ,  label ,        input ,  nocite ,   include ,   includeonly ,   documentstyle ,        documentclass ,   usepackage ,   selectlanguage ,   pagestyle ,        pagenumbering ,  hyphenation ,   pageref ,  and   psfig ,  plus        bibliography   in some installations.  These keywords are case-       sensitive.       such as HREF=, is not normally checked.)htmlcheck       Subfields  that  should  be spell-checked even inside HTML tags.       The default is  alt , so that the ALT= portion of IMG tags  will       be spell-checked.  These keywords are case-insensitive.All  of  the  above  keyword  lists can also be modified by environmentvariables whose names are the same as above, except in uppercase, e.g.,TEXSKIP1.   The  -k switch overrides (or adds to) the environment vari-ables, and the environment variables override or add  to  the  built-indefaults.The  -F switch specifies an external deformatter program.  This programshould read data from its standard input and write to its standard out-put.  The program must produce exactly one character of output for eachcharacter of input, or ispell will lose synchronization and corrupt theoutput  file.  Whitespace characters (especially blanks, tabs, and new-lines) and characters that should be  spell-checked  should  be  passedthrough  unchanged.  Characters that should not be spell-checked shouldbe converted into blanks or other non-word characters.  For example, anHTML  deformatter  might turn all HTML tags into blanks, and also blankout all text delimited by tags such as  code  or  kbd .The -F switch is the preferred way to deformat files  for  ispell,  andeventually will become the only way.If  ispell is invoked without any filenames or mode switches, it entersan interactive mode designed to let the  user  check  the  spelling  ofindividual  words.   The  program repeatedly prompts on standard outputwith  word:  and responds with either  ok  (possibly with  commentary), not found , or  how about  followed by a list of suggestions.The  -l  or   list   option to ispell is used to produce a list of mis-spelled words from the standard input.The -a option is intended to be used  from  other  programs  through  apipe.   In  this  mode, ispell prints a one-line version identificationmessage, and then begins reading lines of input.  For each input  line,a  single  line is written to the standard output for each word checkedfor spelling on the line.  If the word was found in  the  main  dictio-nary,  or  your personal dictionary, then the line contains only a  * .If the word was found through affix removal, then the line  contains  a + ,  a  space,  and the root word.  If the word was found through com-pound formation (concatenation of  two  words,  controlled  by  the  -Coption), then the line contains only a  - .If  the  word is not in the dictionary, but there are near misses, thenthe line contains an  &amp; , a space, the misspelled word,  a  space,  thenumber  of  near misses, the number of characters between the beginningof the line and the beginning of the misspelled word, a colon,  anotherspace,  and  a  list of the near misses separated by commas and spaces.Following the near misses (and identified only by  the  count  of  nearmisses),  if  the word could be formed by adding (illegal) affixes to anary.Finally, if the word does not appear in the dictionary, and  there  areno  near  misses, then the line contains a  # , a space, the misspelledword, a space, and the character offset from the beginning of the line.Each  sentence  of  text  input  is terminated with an additional blankline, indicating that ispell has completed processing the input line.These output lines can be summarized as follows:       OK:    *       Root:  + &lt;root&gt;       Compound:              -       Miss:  &amp;  &lt;original&gt;  &lt;count&gt;  &lt;offset&gt;:  &lt;miss&gt;,  &lt;miss&gt;,  ...,              &lt;guess&gt;, ...       Guess: ? &lt;original&gt; 0 &lt;offset&gt;: &lt;guess&gt;, &lt;guess&gt;, ...       None:  # &lt;original&gt; &lt;offset&gt;For  example,  a  dummy dictionary containing the words  fray ,  Frey , fry , and  refried  might produce the following response to  the  com-mand  echo  frqy refries | ispell -a -m -d ./test.hash :       (#) International Ispell Version 3.0.05 (beta), 08/10/91       &amp; frqy 3 0: fray, Frey, fry       &amp; refries 1 5: refried, re+fry-y+iesThis  mode is also suitable for interactive use when you want to figureout the spelling of a single word.The -A option works just like -a, except that if a line begins with thestring  &amp;Include_File&amp; , the rest of the line is taken as the name of afile to read for further words.  Input returns  to  the  original  filewhen the include file is exhausted.  Inclusion may be nested up to fivedeep.  The key string may be  changed  with  the  environment  variableINCLUDE_STRING (the ampersands, if any, must be included).When in the -a mode, ispell will also accept lines of single words pre-fixed with any of  * ,  &amp; ,  @ ,  + ,  - ,  ~ ,  # ,  ! ,  % ,  ` ,  or ^ .  A line starting with  *  tells ispell to insert the word into theuser s dictionary (similar to the I command).  A line starting with  &amp; tells  ispell  to  insert an all-lowercase version of the word into theuser s dictionary (similar to the U command).  A line starting with  @ causes  ispell to accept this word in the future (similar to the A com-mand).  A line starting with  + , followed immediately by tex or  nroffwill  cause  ispell  to parse future input according the syntax of thatformatter.  A line consisting solely of a   +   will  place  ispell  inTeX/LaTeX  mode  (similar  to  the -t option) and  -  returns ispell tonroff/troff mode (but  these  commands  are  obsolete).   However,  thestring  character  type is not changed; the  ~  command must be used toAny  input  following the prefix characters  + ,  - ,  # ,  ! ,  % , or `  is ignored, as is any input following the filename on a   ~   line.To  allow  spell-checking  of  lines beginning with these characters, aline starting with  ^  has that character removed before it  is  passedto the spell-checking code.  It is recommended that programmatic inter-faces prefix every data line with  an  uparrow  to  protect  themselvesagainst future changes in ispell.To summarize these:       *      Add to personal dictionary       @      Accept word, but leave out of dictionary       #      Save current personal dictionary       ~      Set parameters based on filename       +      Enter TeX mode       -      Exit TeX mode       !      Enter terse mode       %      Exit terse mode       `      Enter verbose-correction mode       ^      Spell-check rest of lineIn  terse mode, ispell will not print lines beginning with  * ,  + , or - , all of which indicate correct words.  This significantly  improvesrunning speed when the driving program is going to ignore correct wordsanyway.In verbose-correction mode, ispell includes the original  word  immedi-ately after the indicator character in output lines beginning with  * , + , and  - , which simplifies interaction for some programs.The -s option is only valid in conjunction with the -a or  -A  options,and only on BSD-derived systems.  If specified, ispell will stop itselfwith a SIGTSTP signal after each line of input.  It will not read  moreinput until it receives a SIGCONT signal.  This may be useful for hand-shaking with certain text editors.The -f option is only valid in conjunction with the -a or  -A  options.If  -f  is  specified, ispell will write its results to the given file,rather than to standard output.The -v option causes ispell to print its current version identificationon the standard output and exit.  If the switch is doubled, ispell willalso print the options that it was compiled with.       BOTHER BOTHE/R BOTH/RThe -e switch is the reverse of -c; it expands affix flags to produce alist of words.  For example, the command:       echo BOTH/R | ispell -eproduces:       BOTH BOTHERAn  optional expansion level can also be specified.  A level of 1 (-e1)is the same as -e alone.  A level of 2 causes the  original  root/affixcombination to be prepended to the line:       BOTH/R BOTH BOTHERA level of 3 causes multiple lines to be output, one for each generatedword, with the original root/affix combination followed by the word  itcreates:       BOTH/R BOTH       BOTH/R BOTHERA  level  of 4 causes a floating-point number to be appended to each ofthe level-3 lines, giving the ratio between the length of the root  andthe total length of all generated words including the root:       BOTH/R BOTH 2.500000       BOTH/R BOTHER 2.500000A level of 5 causes multiple lines to be output, one for each generatedword.  If the generated word did not use any affixes, the line is  justthat word.  If one or more affixes were used, the original root and theaffixes actually used are printed, joined by a plus sign; then the gen-erated word is printed:       BOTH       BOTH+R BOTHERFinally,  the  -D flag causes the affix tables from the dictionary fileto be dumped to standard output.Ispell is aware of the correct capitalizations of words in the  dictio-nary  and  in  your  personal dictionary.  As well as recognizing wordsthat must be capitalized (e.g., George) and words that must be all-cap-itals (e.g., NASA), it can also handle words with  unusual  capitaliza-tion (e.g.,  ITCorp  or  TeX ).  If a word is capitalized  incorrectly,the  list of possibilities will include all acceptable capitalizations.(More than one capitalization may be acceptable; for example,  my  dic-tionary lists both  ITCorp  and  ITcorp .)Normally,  this  feature will not cause you surprises, but there is onecircumstance you need to be aware of.  If you use  I  to add a word  to(1)    Any word may appear in all capitals, as in headings.(2)    Any  word  that  is  in the dictionary in all-lowercase form may       appear either in lowercase or capitalized (as at  the  beginning       of a sentence).(3)    Any word that has  funny  capitalization (i.e., it contains both       cases and there is an uppercase  character  besides  the  first)       must appear exactly as in the dictionary, except as permitted by       rule (1).  If the word is acceptable in all-lowercase,  it  must       appear thus in a dictionary entry.');

The effect of called routines is incorporated in the profileof each caller.  The profile data is taken from the call graph profilefile (gmon.out default) which is created by programs that are compiledwith the -pg option of  cc ,  pc , and  f77 .  The -pg option alsolinks in versions of the library routines that are compiled forprofiling.   Gprof  reads the given object file (the default is a.out ) and establishes the relation between its symbol table and thecall graph profile from gmon.out.  If more than one profile file isspecified, the  gprof  output shows the sum of the profile informationin the given profile files.If you use gcc 2.95.x or 3.0 to compile your binaries, you may need toadd the -fprofile-arcs to the compile command line in order for thecall graphs to be properly stored in gmon.out. Gprof  calculates the amount of time spent in each routine.  Next,these times are propagated along the edges of the call graph.  Cyclesare discovered, and calls into a cycle are made to share the time ofthe cycle.Several forms of output are available from the analysis.The flat profile shows how much time your program spent in eachfunction, and how many times that function was called.  If you simplywant to know which functions burn most of the cycles, it is statedconcisely here.The call graph shows, for each function, which functions called it,which other functions it called, and how many times.  There is also anestimate of how much time was spent in the subroutines of eachfunction.  This can suggest places where you might try to eliminatefunction calls that use a lot of time.Specifying any of these options overrides the default (-p -q), whichprints a flat profile and call graph analysis for all functions. -A[symspec]  --annotated-source[=symspec]     The -A option causes  gprof  to print annotated source code.  If    symspec is specified, print output only for matching symbols. -b  --brief     If the -b option is given,  gprof  doesn t print the verbose blurbs    that try to explain the meaning of all of the fields in the tables.    This is useful if you intend to print out the output, or are tired    of seeing the blurbs. -C[symspec]  --exec-counts[=symspec]     The -C option causes  gprof  to print a tally of functions and the    number of times each was called.  If symspec is specified, print    tally only for matching symbols.    If the profile data file contains basic-block count records,    specifying the -l option, along with -C, will cause basic-block    execution counts to be tallied and displayed. -i  --file-info     The -i option causes  gprof  to display summary information about    the profile data file(s) and then exit.  The number of histogram,    call graph, and basic-block count records is displayed. -I dirs  --directory-path=dirs     The -I option specifies a list of search directories in which to    find source files.  Environment variable GPROF_PATH can also be    used to convey this information.  Used mostly for annotated source    output. -J[symspec]  --no-annotated-source[=symspec]     The -J option causes  gprof  not to print annotated source code.    If symspec is specified,  gprof  prints annotated source, but    excludes matching symbols. -L  --print-path     Normally, source filenames are printed with the path component    suppressed.  The -L option causes  gprof  to print the full    pathname of source filenames, which is determined from symbolic    debugging information in the image file and is relative to the    directory in which the compiler was invoked. -p[symspec]  --flat-profile[=symspec]     symspec is specified, print call graph only for matching symbols    and their children. -Q[symspec]  --no-graph[=symspec]     The -Q option causes  gprof  to suppress printing the call graph.    If symspec is specified,  gprof  prints a call graph, but excludes    matching symbols. -t  --table-length=num     The -t option causes the num most active source lines in each    source file to be listed when source annotation is enabled.  The    default is 10. -y  --separate-files     This option affects annotated source output only.  Normally,     gprof  prints annotated source files to standard-output.  If this    option is specified, annotated source for a file named    path/filename is generated in the file filename-ann.  If the    underlying file system would truncate filename-ann so that it    overwrites the original filename,  gprof  generates annotated    source in the file filename.ann instead (if the original file name    has an extension, that extension is replaced with .ann). -Z[symspec]  --no-exec-counts[=symspec]     The -Z option causes  gprof  not to print a tally of functions and    the number of times each was called.  If symspec is specified,    print tally, but exclude matching symbols. -r  --function-ordering     The --function-ordering option causes  gprof  to print a suggested    function ordering for the program based on profiling data.  This    option suggests an ordering which may improve paging, tlb and cache    behavior for the program on systems which support arbitrary    ordering of functions in an executable.    The exact details of how to force the linker to place functions in    a particular order is system dependent and out of the scope of this    manual. -R map_file  --file-ordering map_file     The --file-ordering option causes  gprof  to print a suggested .o    link line ordering for the program based on profiling data.  This    option suggests an ordering which may improve paging, tlb and cache    behavior for the program on systems which do not support arbitrary    ordering of functions in an executable.    Use of the -a argument is highly recommended with this option.    To create a map_file with GNU  nm , type a command like  nm    --extern-only --defined-only -v --print-file-name program-name . -T  --traditional     The -T option causes  gprof  to print its output in  traditional     BSD style. -w width  --width=width     Sets width of output lines to width.  Currently only used when    printing the function index at the bottom of the call graph. -x  --all-lines     This option affects annotated source output only.  By default, only    the lines at the beginning of a basic-block are annotated.  If this    option is specified, every line in a basic-block is annotated by    repeating the annotation for the first line.  This behavior is    similar to  tcov  s -a. --demangle[=style]  --no-demangle     These options control whether C++ symbol names should be demangled    when printing output.  The default is to demangle symbols.  The     --no-demangle  option may be used to turn off demangling.    Different compilers have different mangling styles.  The optional    demangling style argument can be used to choose an appropriate    demangling style for your compiler.');

After doing this, it reads further input from thestandard input stream (normally the keyboard), interpreting  each  lineseparately.  The  interpreter  exits  gracefully when it encounters the quit  command (either in a file or from the keyboard), at end-of-file,or at an interrupt signal (such as Control-C at the keyboard).The  interpreter  recognizes  many  option  switches, some of which aredescribed below. Please see the usage documentation for complete infor-mation.  Switches  may appear anywhere in the command line and apply toall files thereafter.  Invoking Ghostscript with the -h  or  -?  switchproduces a message which shows several useful switches, all the devicesknown to that executable, and the search path for  fonts;  on  Unix  italso shows the location of detailed documentation.Ghostscript  may be built to use many different output devices.  To seewhich devices your executable includes, run  gs -h .  Unless you  spec-ify  a  particular  device, Ghostscript normally opens the first one ofthose and directs output to it, so if the first one in the list is  theone you want to use, just issue the command     gs myfile.psYou  can  also  check  the  set of available devices from within Ghost-script: invoke Ghostscript and type     devicenames ==but the first device on the resulting  list  may  not  be  the  defaultdevice  you determine with  gs -h .  To specify  AbcXyz  as the initialoutput device, include the switch     -sDEVICE=AbcXyzFor example, for output to an Epson printer you might use the command     gs -sDEVICE=epson myfile.psThe  -sDEVICE=  switch must precede the first  mention  of  a  file  toprint, and only the switch s first use has any effect.Finally,  you  can specify a default device in the environment variableGS_DEVICE.  The order of precedence for these alternatives from highestand the highest-density (best output quality) mode with     gs -sDEVICE=epson -r240x72.If  you  select a printer as the output device, Ghostscript also allowsyou to choose where Ghostscript sends the output --  on  Unix  systems,usually  to  a temporary file.  To send the output to a file  foo.xyz ,use the switch     -sOutputFile=foo.xyzYou might want to print each page separately.

Whenever possible, each file  is  replaced  by  one  with  theextension .gz, while keeping the same ownership modes, access and modi-fication times.  (The default extension is -gz for VMS,  z  for  MSDOS,OS/2  FAT, Windows NT FAT and Atari.)  If no files are specified, or ifa file name is  - , the standard input is compressed  to  the  standardoutput.  Gzip will only attempt to compress regular files.  In particu-lar, it will ignore symbolic links.If the compressed file name is too long for its file system, gzip trun-cates  it.   Gzip  attempts to truncate only the parts of the file namelonger than 3 characters.  (A part is delimited by dots.) If  the  nameconsists  of  small  parts  only,  the longest parts are truncated. Forexample, if file names are limited to 14 characters, gzip.msdos.exe  iscompressed to gzi.msd.exe.gz.  Names are not truncated on systems whichdo not have a limit on file name length.By default, gzip keeps the original file name and timestamp in the com-pressed  file.  These  are used when decompressing the file with the -Noption. This is useful when the compressed file name was  truncated  orwhen the time stamp was not preserved after a file transfer.Compressed  files  can be restored to their original form using gzip -dor gunzip or zcat.  If the original name saved in the  compressed  fileis not suitable for its file system, a new name is constructed from theoriginal one to make it legal.gunzip takes a list of files on its command line and replaces each filewhose  name ends with .gz, -gz, .z, -z, or _z (ignoring case) and whichbegins with the correct magic number with an uncompressed file  withoutthe  original extension.  gunzip also recognizes the special extensions.tgz and .taz as shorthands for .tar.gz and .tar.Z respectively.   Whencompressing, gzip uses the .tgz extension if necessary instead of trun-cating a file with a .tar extension.gunzip can currently decompress files created by gzip,  zip,  compress,compress  -H  or pack.  The detection of the input format is automatic.When using the first two formats, gunzip checks a 32 bit CRC. For pack,gunzip checks the uncompressed length. The standard compress format wasnot designed to allow consistency checks. However gunzip  is  sometimesable  to detect a bad .Z file. If you get an error when uncompressing a.Z file, do not assume that the .Z file is correct simply  because  thestandard  uncompress  does  not complain. This generally means that thestandard uncompress does not check its  input,  and  happily  generatesgarbage  output.   The  SCO compress -H format (lzh compression method)does not include a CRC but also allows some consistency checks..gz suffix or not.Gzip uses the Lempel-Ziv algorithm used in zip and PKZIP.   The  amountof  compression  obtained depends on the size of the input and the dis-tribution of common substrings.  Typically, text such as source code orEnglish  is  reduced  by  60-70%.  Compression is generally much betterthan that achieved by LZW (as used in  compress),  Huffman  coding  (asused in pack), or adaptive Huffman coding (compact).Compression  is  always  performed,  even  if  the  compressed  file isslightly larger than the original. The worst case expansion  is  a  fewbytes  for  the  gzip  file header, plus 5 bytes every 32K block, or anexpansion ratio of 0.015% for large files. Note that the actual  numberof  used  disk blocks almost never increases.  gzip preserves the mode,ownership and timestamps of files when compressing or decompressing.The gzip file format is specified in P. Deutsch, GZIP file format spec-ification version 4.3, &lt;ftp://ftp.isi.edu/in-notes/rfc1952.txt&gt;, Inter-net RFC 1952 (May 1996).

Whenever possible, each file  is  replaced  by  one  with  theextension .gz, while keeping the same ownership modes, access and modi-fication times.  (The default extension is -gz for VMS,  z  for  MSDOS,OS/2  FAT, Windows NT FAT and Atari.)  If no files are specified, or ifa file name is  - , the standard input is compressed  to  the  standardoutput.  Gzip will only attempt to compress regular files.  In particu-lar, it will ignore symbolic links.If the compressed file name is too long for its file system, gzip trun-cates  it.   Gzip  attempts to truncate only the parts of the file namelonger than 3 characters.  (A part is delimited by dots.) If  the  nameconsists  of  small  parts  only,  the longest parts are truncated. Forexample, if file names are limited to 14 characters, gzip.msdos.exe  iscompressed to gzi.msd.exe.gz.  Names are not truncated on systems whichdo not have a limit on file name length.By default, gzip keeps the original file name and timestamp in the com-pressed  file.  These  are used when decompressing the file with the -Noption. This is useful when the compressed file name was  truncated  orwhen the time stamp was not preserved after a file transfer.Compressed  files  can be restored to their original form using gzip -dor gunzip or zcat.  If the original name saved in the  compressed  fileis not suitable for its file system, a new name is constructed from theoriginal one to make it legal.gunzip takes a list of files on its command line and replaces each filewhose  name ends with .gz, -gz, .z, -z, or _z (ignoring case) and whichbegins with the correct magic number with an uncompressed file  withoutthe  original extension.  gunzip also recognizes the special extensions.tgz and .taz as shorthands for .tar.gz and .tar.Z respectively.   Whencompressing, gzip uses the .tgz extension if necessary instead of trun-cating a file with a .tar extension.gunzip can currently decompress files created by gzip,  zip,  compress,compress  -H  or pack.  The detection of the input format is automatic.When using the first two formats, gunzip checks a 32 bit CRC. For pack,gunzip checks the uncompressed length. The standard compress format wasnot designed to allow consistency checks. However gunzip  is  sometimesable  to detect a bad .Z file. If you get an error when uncompressing a.Z file, do not assume that the .Z file is correct simply  because  thestandard  uncompress  does  not complain. This generally means that thestandard uncompress does not check its  input,  and  happily  generatesgarbage  output.   The  SCO compress -H format (lzh compression method)does not include a CRC but also allows some consistency checks..gz suffix or not.Gzip uses the Lempel-Ziv algorithm used in zip and PKZIP.   The  amountof  compression  obtained depends on the size of the input and the dis-tribution of common substrings.  Typically, text such as source code orEnglish  is  reduced  by  60-70%.  Compression is generally much betterthan that achieved by LZW (as used in  compress),  Huffman  coding  (asused in pack), or adaptive Huffman coding (compact).Compression  is  always  performed,  even  if  the  compressed  file isslightly larger than the original. The worst case expansion  is  a  fewbytes  for  the  gzip  file header, plus 5 bytes every 32K block, or anexpansion ratio of 0.015% for large files. Note that the actual  numberof  used  disk blocks almost never increases.  gzip preserves the mode,ownership and timestamps of files when compressing or decompressing.The gzip file format is specified in P.

(The  default mode is controlled by the DEFTEXFLAG installationoption, but is  normally  nroff/troff  mode  for  historical  reasons.)Unless overridden by one of the mode-selection switches, TeX/LaTeX modeis automatically selected if an input file has  the  extension   .tex ,and HTML mode is automatically selected if an input file has the exten-sion  .html  or  .htm .In HTML mode, HTML tags delimited by &lt;&gt; signs are skipped, except  thatthe   ALT=  construct is recognized if it appears with no spaces aroundthe equals sign, and the text inside is spell-checked.In TeX/LaTeX mode, whenever a backslash ( \\ )  is  found,  ispell  willskip  to  the next whitespace or TeX/LaTeX delimiter.  Certain commandscontain arguments which should not be checked, such as labels and  ref-erence keys as are found in the \\cite command, since they contain arbi-trary, non-word arguments.  Spell checking is also suppressed  when  inmath mode.  Thus, for example, given       \\chapter {This is a Ckapter} \\cite{SCH86}ispell  will find  Ckapter  but not  SCH .  The -t option does not rec-ognize the TeX comment character   % ,  so  comments  are  also  spell-checked.   It  also  assumes correct LaTeX syntax.  Arguments to infre-quently used commands and some optional arguments are sometimes checkedunnecessarily.  The bibliography will not be checked if ispell was com-piled with IGNOREBIB defined.   Otherwise,  the  bibliography  will  bechecked but the reference key will not.References for the tib (if available on your system), bibliography sys-tem, that is, text between a ``[.   or ``&lt;.   and ``.]   or ``.&gt;   willalways be ignored in TeX/LaTeX mode.The  -b  and  -x  options control whether ispell leaves a backup (.bak)file for each input file.  The .bak  file  contains  the  pre-correctedtext.  If there are file opening / writing errors, the .bak file may beleft for recovery purposes even with the -x option.   The  default  forthis option is controlled by the DEFNOBACKUPFLAG installation option.installation the default may vary depending  on  which  dictionary  youchoose.The  -P and -m options control when ispell automatically generates sug-gested root/affix combinations for possible addition to  your  personaldictionary.   (These are the entries in the  guess  list which are pre-ceded by question marks.)  If -P is specified, such  guesses  are  dis-played  only if ispell cannot generate any possibilities that match thecurrent dictionary.  If -m is specified, such guesses are  always  dis-played.   This can be useful if the dictionary has a limited word list,or a word list with few suffixes.  However, you should be careful  whenusing  this  option,  as  it  can generate guesses that produce illegalwords.  The default for this option is  controlled  by  the  dictionaryfile used.The  -S  option suppresses ispell s normal behavior of sorting the listof possible replacement words.  Some people may prefer this,  since  itsomewhat  enhances  the  probability that the correct word will be low-numbered.The -d option is used to specify an alternate hashed  dictionary  file,other  than  the  default.  If the filename does not contain a  / , thelibrary directory for the default dictionary file is prefixed; thus, touse  a  dictionary in the local directory  -d ./xxx.hash  must be used.This is useful to allow dictionaries for alternate  languages.   Unlikeprevious  versions  of  ispell,  a  dictionary of /dev/null is illegal,because the dictionary contains the affix table.  If you need an effec-tively  empty  dictionary,  create  a  one-entry  list with an unlikelystring (e.g.,  qqqqq ).The -p option is used to specify an alternate personal dictionary file.If the file name does not begin with  / , $HOME is prefixed.  Also, theshell variable WORDLIST may be set, which renames the personal  dictio-nary  in the same manner.  The command line overrides any WORDLIST set-ting.  If neither the -p switch nor the WORDLIST  environment  variableis given, ispell will search for a personal dictionary in both the cur-rent directory and $HOME, creating one in $HOME if none is found.   Thepreferred  name is constructed by appending  .ispell_  to the base nameof the hash file.  For example, if you use the English dictionary, yourpersonal  dictionary would be named  .ispell_english .  However, if thefile  .ispell_words  exists, it will be used as the personal dictionaryregardless  of the language hash file chosen.  This feature is includedprimarily for backwards compatibility.If the -p option is not specified, ispell will look for  personal  dic-tionaries  in  both  the  current directory and the home directory.  Ifdictionaries exist in both places, they will be merged.  If  any  wordsare  added to the personal dictionary, they will be written to the cur-rent directory if a dictionary already existed in that place; otherwisethey will be written to the dictionary in the home directory.The  -w option may be used to specify characters other than alphabeticswhich may also appear in words.  For instance, -w  &amp;  will allow  AT&amp;T to  be  picked up.  Underscores are useful in many technical documents.characters.  Use of  n  does not conflict with anything because  actualalphabetics have no meaning - alphabetics are already accepted.  Ispellwill typically be used with input from a file, meaning that  preservingparity for possible 8 bit characters from the input text is OK.  If youspecify the -l option, and actually type text from the  terminal,  thismay create problems if your stty settings preserve parity.It  is  not possible to use -w with certain characters.  In particular,the flag-marker character for the language (defined in the affix  file,but usually  / ) can never be made into a word character.The  -W  option  may  be used to change the length of words that ispellalways accepts as legal.  Normally, ispell will accept all  1-characterwords as legal, which is equivalent to specifying  -W 1.   (The defaultfor this switch is actually  controlled  by  the  MINWORD  installationoption, so it may vary at your installation.)  If you want all words tobe checked against the dictionary, regardless of length, you might wantto specify  -W 0.   On the other hand, if your document specifies a lotof three-letter acronyms, you would specify  -W 3  to accept all  wordsof  three  letters  or less.  Regardless of the setting of this option,ispell will only generate words that are in the dictionary as suggestedreplacements  for words; this prevents the list from becoming too long.Obviously, this option can be very dangerous, since short  misspellingsmay  be missed.  If you use this option a lot, you should probably makea last pass without it before you publish  your  document,  to  protectyourself against errors.The  -T  option  is used to specify a default formatter type for use ingenerating string characters.  This switch overrides the  default  typedetermined  from the file name.  The type argument may be either one ofthe unique names defined in the language affix file (e.g., nroff) or  afile  suffix  including  the dot (e.g., .tex).  If no -T option appearsand no type can be determined from the file name,  the  default  stringcharacter type declared in the language affix file will be used.The  -k option is used to enhance the behavior of certain deformatters.The name parameter gives the name of a  deformatter  keyword  set  (seebelow),  and  the  list  parameter gives a list of one or more keywordsthat are to be treated specially.  If list begins with a plus (+) sign,it  is added to the existing keywords; otherwise it replaces the exist-ing keyword list.   For  example,  -ktexskip1  +bibliographystyle  adds bibliographystyle    to   the  TeX  skip-1  list,  while  -khtmlignorepre,strong replaces the HTML ignore list with  pre  and  strong .   Thelists available are:texskip1       TeX/LaTeX  commands  that take a single argument that should not       be spell-checked, such as  bibliographystyle .  The  default  is        end ,   vspace ,   hspace ,   cite ,   ref ,  parbox ,  label ,        input ,  nocite ,   include ,   includeonly ,   documentstyle ,        documentclass ,   usepackage ,   selectlanguage ,   pagestyle ,        pagenumbering ,  hyphenation ,   pageref ,  and   psfig ,  plus        bibliography   in some installations.  These keywords are case-       sensitive.       such as HREF=, is not normally checked.)htmlcheck       Subfields  that  should  be spell-checked even inside HTML tags.       The default is  alt , so that the ALT= portion of IMG tags  will       be spell-checked.  These keywords are case-insensitive.All  of  the  above  keyword  lists can also be modified by environmentvariables whose names are the same as above, except in uppercase, e.g.,TEXSKIP1.   The  -k switch overrides (or adds to) the environment vari-ables, and the environment variables override or add  to  the  built-indefaults.The  -F switch specifies an external deformatter program.  This programshould read data from its standard input and write to its standard out-put.  The program must produce exactly one character of output for eachcharacter of input, or ispell will lose synchronization and corrupt theoutput  file.  Whitespace characters (especially blanks, tabs, and new-lines) and characters that should be  spell-checked  should  be  passedthrough  unchanged.  Characters that should not be spell-checked shouldbe converted into blanks or other non-word characters.  For example, anHTML  deformatter  might turn all HTML tags into blanks, and also blankout all text delimited by tags such as  code  or  kbd .The -F switch is the preferred way to deformat files  for  ispell,  andeventually will become the only way.If  ispell is invoked without any filenames or mode switches, it entersan interactive mode designed to let the  user  check  the  spelling  ofindividual  words.   The  program repeatedly prompts on standard outputwith  word:  and responds with either  ok  (possibly with  commentary), not found , or  how about  followed by a list of suggestions.The  -l  or   list   option to ispell is used to produce a list of mis-spelled words from the standard input.The -a option is intended to be used  from  other  programs  through  apipe.   In  this  mode, ispell prints a one-line version identificationmessage, and then begins reading lines of input.  For each input  line,a  single  line is written to the standard output for each word checkedfor spelling on the line.  If the word was found in  the  main  dictio-nary,  or  your personal dictionary, then the line contains only a  * .If the word was found through affix removal, then the line  contains  a + ,  a  space,  and the root word.  If the word was found through com-pound formation (concatenation of  two  words,  controlled  by  the  -Coption), then the line contains only a  - .If  the  word is not in the dictionary, but there are near misses, thenthe line contains an  &amp; , a space, the misspelled word,  a  space,  thenumber  of  near misses, the number of characters between the beginningof the line and the beginning of the misspelled word, a colon,  anotherspace,  and  a  list of the near misses separated by commas and spaces.Following the near misses (and identified only by  the  count  of  nearmisses),  if  the word could be formed by adding (illegal) affixes to anary.Finally, if the word does not appear in the dictionary, and  there  areno  near  misses, then the line contains a  # , a space, the misspelledword, a space, and the character offset from the beginning of the line.Each  sentence  of  text  input  is terminated with an additional blankline, indicating that ispell has completed processing the input line.These output lines can be summarized as follows:       OK:    *       Root:  + &lt;root&gt;       Compound:              -       Miss:  &amp;  &lt;original&gt;  &lt;count&gt;  &lt;offset&gt;:  &lt;miss&gt;,  &lt;miss&gt;,  ...,              &lt;guess&gt;, ...       Guess: ? &lt;original&gt; 0 &lt;offset&gt;: &lt;guess&gt;, &lt;guess&gt;, ...       None:  # &lt;original&gt; &lt;offset&gt;For  example,  a  dummy dictionary containing the words  fray ,  Frey , fry , and  refried  might produce the following response to  the  com-mand  echo  frqy refries | ispell -a -m -d ./test.hash :       (#) International Ispell Version 3.0.05 (beta), 08/10/91       &amp; frqy 3 0: fray, Frey, fry       &amp; refries 1 5: refried, re+fry-y+iesThis  mode is also suitable for interactive use when you want to figureout the spelling of a single word.The -A option works just like -a, except that if a line begins with thestring  &amp;Include_File&amp; , the rest of the line is taken as the name of afile to read for further words.  Input returns  to  the  original  filewhen the include file is exhausted.  Inclusion may be nested up to fivedeep.  The key string may be  changed  with  the  environment  variableINCLUDE_STRING (the ampersands, if any, must be included).When in the -a mode, ispell will also accept lines of single words pre-fixed with any of  * ,  &amp; ,  @ ,  + ,  - ,  ~ ,  # ,  ! ,  % ,  ` ,  or ^ .  A line starting with  *  tells ispell to insert the word into theuser s dictionary (similar to the I command).  A line starting with  &amp; tells  ispell  to  insert an all-lowercase version of the word into theuser s dictionary (similar to the U command).  A line starting with  @ causes  ispell to accept this word in the future (similar to the A com-mand).  A line starting with  + , followed immediately by tex or  nroffwill  cause  ispell  to parse future input according the syntax of thatformatter.  A line consisting solely of a   +   will  place  ispell  inTeX/LaTeX  mode  (similar  to  the -t option) and  -  returns ispell tonroff/troff mode (but  these  commands  are  obsolete).   However,  thestring  character  type is not changed; the  ~  command must be used toAny  input  following the prefix characters  + ,  - ,  # ,  ! ,  % , or `  is ignored, as is any input following the filename on a   ~   line.To  allow  spell-checking  of  lines beginning with these characters, aline starting with  ^  has that character removed before it  is  passedto the spell-checking code.  It is recommended that programmatic inter-faces prefix every data line with  an  uparrow  to  protect  themselvesagainst future changes in ispell.To summarize these:       *      Add to personal dictionary       @      Accept word, but leave out of dictionary       #      Save current personal dictionary       ~      Set parameters based on filename       +      Enter TeX mode       -      Exit TeX mode       !      Enter terse mode       %      Exit terse mode       `      Enter verbose-correction mode       ^      Spell-check rest of lineIn  terse mode, ispell will not print lines beginning with  * ,  + , or - , all of which indicate correct words.  This significantly  improvesrunning speed when the driving program is going to ignore correct wordsanyway.In verbose-correction mode, ispell includes the original  word  immedi-ately after the indicator character in output lines beginning with  * , + , and  - , which simplifies interaction for some programs.The -s option is only valid in conjunction with the -a or  -A  options,and only on BSD-derived systems.  If specified, ispell will stop itselfwith a SIGTSTP signal after each line of input.  It will not read  moreinput until it receives a SIGCONT signal.  This may be useful for hand-shaking with certain text editors.The -f option is only valid in conjunction with the -a or  -A  options.If  -f  is  specified, ispell will write its results to the given file,rather than to standard output.The -v option causes ispell to print its current version identificationon the standard output and exit.  If the switch is doubled, ispell willalso print the options that it was compiled with.       BOTHER BOTHE/R BOTH/RThe -e switch is the reverse of -c; it expands affix flags to produce alist of words.  For example, the command:       echo BOTH/R | ispell -eproduces:       BOTH BOTHERAn  optional expansion level can also be specified.  A level of 1 (-e1)is the same as -e alone.  A level of 2 causes the  original  root/affixcombination to be prepended to the line:       BOTH/R BOTH BOTHERA level of 3 causes multiple lines to be output, one for each generatedword, with the original root/affix combination followed by the word  itcreates:       BOTH/R BOTH       BOTH/R BOTHERA  level  of 4 causes a floating-point number to be appended to each ofthe level-3 lines, giving the ratio between the length of the root  andthe total length of all generated words including the root:       BOTH/R BOTH 2.500000       BOTH/R BOTHER 2.500000A level of 5 causes multiple lines to be output, one for each generatedword.  If the generated word did not use any affixes, the line is  justthat word.  If one or more affixes were used, the original root and theaffixes actually used are printed, joined by a plus sign; then the gen-erated word is printed:       BOTH       BOTH+R BOTHERFinally,  the  -D flag causes the affix tables from the dictionary fileto be dumped to standard output.Ispell is aware of the correct capitalizations of words in the  dictio-nary  and  in  your  personal dictionary.  As well as recognizing wordsthat must be capitalized (e.g., George) and words that must be all-cap-itals (e.g., NASA), it can also handle words with  unusual  capitaliza-tion (e.g.,  ITCorp  or  TeX ).  If a word is capitalized  incorrectly,the  list of possibilities will include all acceptable capitalizations.(More than one capitalization may be acceptable; for example,  my  dic-tionary lists both  ITCorp  and  ITcorp .)Normally,  this  feature will not cause you surprises, but there is onecircumstance you need to be aware of.  If you use  I  to add a word  to(1)    Any word may appear in all capitals, as in headings.(2)    Any  word  that  is  in the dictionary in all-lowercase form may       appear either in lowercase or capitalized (as at  the  beginning       of a sentence).(3)    Any word that has  funny  capitalization (i.e., it contains both       cases and there is an uppercase  character  besides  the  first)       must appear exactly as in the dictionary, except as permitted by       rule (1).  If the word is acceptable in all-lowercase,  it  must       appear thus in a dictionary entry.');

The most common usage is  ispell filename .  In  thiscase,  ispell  will display each word which does not appear in the dic-tionary at the top of the screen and allow you to change it.  If  thereare   near misses  in the dictionary (words which differ by only a sin-gle letter, a missing or extra letter, a pair of transposed letters, ora  missing  space or hyphen), then they are also displayed on followinglines.  As well as  near misses , ispell may display other  guesses  atways  to  make  the word from a known root, with each guess preceded byquestion marks.

Conversely, the -N switch maybe  used  to  suppress  the  mini-menu.   (The minimenu is displayed bydefault if ispell was compiled with the MINIMENU option, but these  twoswitches will always override the default).If  the -L flag is given, the specified number is used as the number oflines of context to be shown at the bottom of the screen  (The  defaultis  to  calculate  the amount of context as a certain percentage of thescreen size).  The amount of context is  subject  to  a  system-imposedlimit.If  the  -V  flag  is  given, characters that are not in the 7-bit ANSIprintable character set will always be displayed in the style  of   cat-v ,  even if ispell thinks that these characters are legal ISO Latin-1on your system.  This is useful  when  working  with  older  terminals.Without  this  switch,  ispell will display 8-bit characters  as is  ifthey have been defined as string characters for the chosen file type. Normal  mode, as well as the -l, -a, and -A  options  and  interactivemode  (see below) also accepts the following  common  flags on the com-mand line:       -t     The input file is in TeX or LaTeX format.       -n     The input file is in nroff/troff format.       -H     The input file is  in  SGML/HTML  format.   (This  should              really  be  -s,  but for historical reasons that flag was              already taken.)       -o     The input file should be treated as ordinary text.  (This              could be used to override DEFTEXFLAG.)       -g     The  input file is in Debian control file format.  Ispell              will ignore everything outside the Description(s).       -b     Create a backup file by appending  .bak  to the  name  of              the input file.       -x     Delete the backup file after spell-checking is finished.       -B     Report run-together words with missing blanks as spelling              Specify  an  alternate dictionary file.  For example, use              -d british to  choose  /usr/lib/ispell/british.{aff|hash}              instead of your default ispell dictionary.       -p file              Specify an alternate personal dictionary.       -w chars              Specify additional characters that can be part of a word.       -W n   Specify length of words that are always legal.       -T type              Assume a given formatter type for all files.The -H, -n, -t, and -o options select whether ispell runs in HTML (-H),nroff/troff (-n), TeX/LaTeX (-t), or ordinary  text  (-o)  input  mode.mode.   (The  default mode is controlled by the DEFTEXFLAG installationoption, but is  normally  nroff/troff  mode  for  historical  reasons.)Unless overridden by one of the mode-selection switches, TeX/LaTeX modeis automatically selected if an input file has  the  extension   .tex ,and HTML mode is automatically selected if an input file has the exten-sion  .html  or  .htm .In HTML mode, HTML tags delimited by &lt;&gt; signs are skipped, except  thatthe   ALT=  construct is recognized if it appears with no spaces aroundthe equals sign, and the text inside is spell-checked.In TeX/LaTeX mode, whenever a backslash ( \\ )  is  found,  ispell  willskip  to  the next whitespace or TeX/LaTeX delimiter.  Certain commandscontain arguments which should not be checked, such as labels and  ref-erence keys as are found in the \\cite command, since they contain arbi-trary, non-word arguments.  Spell checking is also suppressed  when  inmath mode.  Thus, for example, given       \\chapter {This is a Ckapter} \\cite{SCH86}ispell  will find  Ckapter  but not  SCH .  The -t option does not rec-ognize the TeX comment character   % ,  so  comments  are  also  spell-checked.   It  also  assumes correct LaTeX syntax.  Arguments to infre-quently used commands and some optional arguments are sometimes checkedunnecessarily.  The bibliography will not be checked if ispell was com-piled with IGNOREBIB defined.   Otherwise,  the  bibliography  will  bechecked but the reference key will not.References for the tib (if available on your system), bibliography sys-tem, that is, text between a ``[.   or ``&lt;.   and ``.]   or ``.&gt;   willalways be ignored in TeX/LaTeX mode.The  -b  and  -x  options control whether ispell leaves a backup (.bak)file for each input file.  The .bak  file  contains  the  pre-correctedtext.  If there are file opening / writing errors, the .bak file may beleft for recovery purposes even with the -x option.   The  default  forthis option is controlled by the DEFNOBACKUPFLAG installation option.installation the default may vary depending  on  which  dictionary  youchoose.The  -P and -m options control when ispell automatically generates sug-gested root/affix combinations for possible addition to  your  personaldictionary.   (These are the entries in the  guess  list which are pre-ceded by question marks.)  If -P is specified, such  guesses  are  dis-played  only if ispell cannot generate any possibilities that match thecurrent dictionary.  If -m is specified, such guesses are  always  dis-played.   This can be useful if the dictionary has a limited word list,or a word list with few suffixes.  However, you should be careful  whenusing  this  option,  as  it  can generate guesses that produce illegalwords.  The default for this option is  controlled  by  the  dictionaryfile used.The  -S  option suppresses ispell s normal behavior of sorting the listof possible replacement words.  Some people may prefer this,  since  itsomewhat  enhances  the  probability that the correct word will be low-numbered.The -d option is used to specify an alternate hashed  dictionary  file,other  than  the  default.  If the filename does not contain a  / , thelibrary directory for the default dictionary file is prefixed; thus, touse  a  dictionary in the local directory  -d ./xxx.hash  must be used.This is useful to allow dictionaries for alternate  languages.   Unlikeprevious  versions  of  ispell,  a  dictionary of /dev/null is illegal,because the dictionary contains the affix table.  If you need an effec-tively  empty  dictionary,  create  a  one-entry  list with an unlikelystring (e.g.,  qqqqq ).The -p option is used to specify an alternate personal dictionary file.If the file name does not begin with  / , $HOME is prefixed.  Also, theshell variable WORDLIST may be set, which renames the personal  dictio-nary  in the same manner.  The command line overrides any WORDLIST set-ting.  If neither the -p switch nor the WORDLIST  environment  variableis given, ispell will search for a personal dictionary in both the cur-rent directory and $HOME, creating one in $HOME if none is found.   Thepreferred  name is constructed by appending  .ispell_  to the base nameof the hash file.  For example, if you use the English dictionary, yourpersonal  dictionary would be named  .ispell_english .  However, if thefile  .ispell_words  exists, it will be used as the personal dictionaryregardless  of the language hash file chosen.  This feature is includedprimarily for backwards compatibility.If the -p option is not specified, ispell will look for  personal  dic-tionaries  in  both  the  current directory and the home directory.  Ifdictionaries exist in both places, they will be merged.  If  any  wordsare  added to the personal dictionary, they will be written to the cur-rent directory if a dictionary already existed in that place; otherwisethey will be written to the dictionary in the home directory.The  -w option may be used to specify characters other than alphabeticswhich may also appear in words.  For instance, -w  &amp;  will allow  AT&amp;T to  be  picked up.  Underscores are useful in many technical documents.characters.  Use of  n  does not conflict with anything because  actualalphabetics have no meaning - alphabetics are already accepted.  Ispellwill typically be used with input from a file, meaning that  preservingparity for possible 8 bit characters from the input text is OK.  If youspecify the -l option, and actually type text from the  terminal,  thismay create problems if your stty settings preserve parity.It  is  not possible to use -w with certain characters.  In particular,the flag-marker character for the language (defined in the affix  file,but usually  / ) can never be made into a word character.The  -W  option  may  be used to change the length of words that ispellalways accepts as legal.  Normally, ispell will accept all  1-characterwords as legal, which is equivalent to specifying  -W 1.   (The defaultfor this switch is actually  controlled  by  the  MINWORD  installationoption, so it may vary at your installation.)  If you want all words tobe checked against the dictionary, regardless of length, you might wantto specify  -W 0.   On the other hand, if your document specifies a lotof three-letter acronyms, you would specify  -W 3  to accept all  wordsof  three  letters  or less.  Regardless of the setting of this option,ispell will only generate words that are in the dictionary as suggestedreplacements  for words; this prevents the list from becoming too long.Obviously, this option can be very dangerous, since short  misspellingsmay  be missed.  If you use this option a lot, you should probably makea last pass without it before you publish  your  document,  to  protectyourself against errors.The  -T  option  is used to specify a default formatter type for use ingenerating string characters.  This switch overrides the  default  typedetermined  from the file name.  The type argument may be either one ofthe unique names defined in the language affix file (e.g., nroff) or  afile  suffix  including  the dot (e.g., .tex).  If no -T option appearsand no type can be determined from the file name,  the  default  stringcharacter type declared in the language affix file will be used.The  -k option is used to enhance the behavior of certain deformatters.The name parameter gives the name of a  deformatter  keyword  set  (seebelow),  and  the  list  parameter gives a list of one or more keywordsthat are to be treated specially.  If list begins with a plus (+) sign,it  is added to the existing keywords; otherwise it replaces the exist-ing keyword list.   For  example,  -ktexskip1  +bibliographystyle  adds bibliographystyle    to   the  TeX  skip-1  list,  while  -khtmlignorepre,strong replaces the HTML ignore list with  pre  and  strong .   Thelists available are:texskip1       TeX/LaTeX  commands  that take a single argument that should not       be spell-checked, such as  bibliographystyle .  The  default  is        end ,   vspace ,   hspace ,   cite ,   ref ,  parbox ,  label ,        input ,  nocite ,   include ,   includeonly ,   documentstyle ,        documentclass ,   usepackage ,   selectlanguage ,   pagestyle ,        pagenumbering ,  hyphenation ,   pageref ,  and   psfig ,  plus        bibliography   in some installations.  These keywords are case-       sensitive.       such as HREF=, is not normally checked.)htmlcheck       Subfields  that  should  be spell-checked even inside HTML tags.       The default is  alt , so that the ALT= portion of IMG tags  will       be spell-checked.  These keywords are case-insensitive.All  of  the  above  keyword  lists can also be modified by environmentvariables whose names are the same as above, except in uppercase, e.g.,TEXSKIP1.   The  -k switch overrides (or adds to) the environment vari-ables, and the environment variables override or add  to  the  built-indefaults.The  -F switch specifies an external deformatter program.  This programshould read data from its standard input and write to its standard out-put.  The program must produce exactly one character of output for eachcharacter of input, or ispell will lose synchronization and corrupt theoutput  file.  Whitespace characters (especially blanks, tabs, and new-lines) and characters that should be  spell-checked  should  be  passedthrough  unchanged.  Characters that should not be spell-checked shouldbe converted into blanks or other non-word characters.  For example, anHTML  deformatter  might turn all HTML tags into blanks, and also blankout all text delimited by tags such as  code  or  kbd .The -F switch is the preferred way to deformat files  for  ispell,  andeventually will become the only way.If  ispell is invoked without any filenames or mode switches, it entersan interactive mode designed to let the  user  check  the  spelling  ofindividual  words.   The  program repeatedly prompts on standard outputwith  word:  and responds with either  ok  (possibly with  commentary), not found , or  how about  followed by a list of suggestions.The  -l  or   list   option to ispell is used to produce a list of mis-spelled words from the standard input.The -a option is intended to be used  from  other  programs  through  apipe.   In  this  mode, ispell prints a one-line version identificationmessage, and then begins reading lines of input.  For each input  line,a  single  line is written to the standard output for each word checkedfor spelling on the line.  If the word was found in  the  main  dictio-nary,  or  your personal dictionary, then the line contains only a  * .If the word was found through affix removal, then the line  contains  a + ,  a  space,  and the root word.  If the word was found through com-pound formation (concatenation of  two  words,  controlled  by  the  -Coption), then the line contains only a  - .If  the  word is not in the dictionary, but there are near misses, thenthe line contains an  &amp; , a space, the misspelled word,  a  space,  thenumber  of  near misses, the number of characters between the beginningof the line and the beginning of the misspelled word, a colon,  anotherspace,  and  a  list of the near misses separated by commas and spaces.Following the near misses (and identified only by  the  count  of  nearmisses),  if  the word could be formed by adding (illegal) affixes to anary.Finally, if the word does not appear in the dictionary, and  there  areno  near  misses, then the line contains a  # , a space, the misspelledword, a space, and the character offset from the beginning of the line.Each  sentence  of  text  input  is terminated with an additional blankline, indicating that ispell has completed processing the input line.These output lines can be summarized as follows:       OK:    *       Root:  + &lt;root&gt;       Compound:              -       Miss:  &amp;  &lt;original&gt;  &lt;count&gt;  &lt;offset&gt;:  &lt;miss&gt;,  &lt;miss&gt;,  ...,              &lt;guess&gt;, ...       Guess: ? &lt;original&gt; 0 &lt;offset&gt;: &lt;guess&gt;, &lt;guess&gt;, ...       None:  # &lt;original&gt; &lt;offset&gt;For  example,  a  dummy dictionary containing the words  fray ,  Frey , fry , and  refried  might produce the following response to  the  com-mand  echo  frqy refries | ispell -a -m -d ./test.hash :       (#) International Ispell Version 3.0.05 (beta), 08/10/91       &amp; frqy 3 0: fray, Frey, fry       &amp; refries 1 5: refried, re+fry-y+iesThis  mode is also suitable for interactive use when you want to figureout the spelling of a single word.The -A option works just like -a, except that if a line begins with thestring  &amp;Include_File&amp; , the rest of the line is taken as the name of afile to read for further words.  Input returns  to  the  original  filewhen the include file is exhausted.  Inclusion may be nested up to fivedeep.  The key string may be  changed  with  the  environment  variableINCLUDE_STRING (the ampersands, if any, must be included).When in the -a mode, ispell will also accept lines of single words pre-fixed with any of  * ,  &amp; ,  @ ,  + ,  - ,  ~ ,  # ,  ! ,  % ,  ` ,  or ^ .  A line starting with  *  tells ispell to insert the word into theuser s dictionary (similar to the I command).  A line starting with  &amp; tells  ispell  to  insert an all-lowercase version of the word into theuser s dictionary (similar to the U command).  A line starting with  @ causes  ispell to accept this word in the future (similar to the A com-mand).  A line starting with  + , followed immediately by tex or  nroffwill  cause  ispell  to parse future input according the syntax of thatformatter.  A line consisting solely of a   +   will  place  ispell  inTeX/LaTeX  mode  (similar  to  the -t option) and  -  returns ispell tonroff/troff mode (but  these  commands  are  obsolete).   However,  thestring  character  type is not changed; the  ~  command must be used toAny  input  following the prefix characters  + ,  - ,  # ,  ! ,  % , or `  is ignored, as is any input following the filename on a   ~   line.To  allow  spell-checking  of  lines beginning with these characters, aline starting with  ^  has that character removed before it  is  passedto the spell-checking code.  It is recommended that programmatic inter-faces prefix every data line with  an  uparrow  to  protect  themselvesagainst future changes in ispell.To summarize these:       *      Add to personal dictionary       @      Accept word, but leave out of dictionary       #      Save current personal dictionary       ~      Set parameters based on filename       +      Enter TeX mode       -      Exit TeX mode       !      Enter terse mode       %      Exit terse mode       `      Enter verbose-correction mode       ^      Spell-check rest of lineIn  terse mode, ispell will not print lines beginning with  * ,  + , or - , all of which indicate correct words.  This significantly  improvesrunning speed when the driving program is going to ignore correct wordsanyway.In verbose-correction mode, ispell includes the original  word  immedi-ately after the indicator character in output lines beginning with  * , + , and  - , which simplifies interaction for some programs.The -s option is only valid in conjunction with the -a or  -A  options,and only on BSD-derived systems.  If specified, ispell will stop itselfwith a SIGTSTP signal after each line of input.  It will not read  moreinput until it receives a SIGCONT signal.  This may be useful for hand-shaking with certain text editors.The -f option is only valid in conjunction with the -a or  -A  options.If  -f  is  specified, ispell will write its results to the given file,rather than to standard output.The -v option causes ispell to print its current version identificationon the standard output and exit.  If the switch is doubled, ispell willalso print the options that it was compiled with.       BOTHER BOTHE/R BOTH/RThe -e switch is the reverse of -c; it expands affix flags to produce alist of words.  For example, the command:       echo BOTH/R | ispell -eproduces:       BOTH BOTHERAn  optional expansion level can also be specified.  A level of 1 (-e1)is the same as -e alone.  A level of 2 causes the  original  root/affixcombination to be prepended to the line:       BOTH/R BOTH BOTHERA level of 3 causes multiple lines to be output, one for each generatedword, with the original root/affix combination followed by the word  itcreates:       BOTH/R BOTH       BOTH/R BOTHERA  level  of 4 causes a floating-point number to be appended to each ofthe level-3 lines, giving the ratio between the length of the root  andthe total length of all generated words including the root:       BOTH/R BOTH 2.500000       BOTH/R BOTHER 2.500000A level of 5 causes multiple lines to be output, one for each generatedword.  If the generated word did not use any affixes, the line is  justthat word.  If one or more affixes were used, the original root and theaffixes actually used are printed, joined by a plus sign; then the gen-erated word is printed:       BOTH       BOTH+R BOTHERFinally,  the  -D flag causes the affix tables from the dictionary fileto be dumped to standard output.Ispell is aware of the correct capitalizations of words in the  dictio-nary  and  in  your  personal dictionary.  As well as recognizing wordsthat must be capitalized (e.g., George) and words that must be all-cap-itals (e.g., NASA), it can also handle words with  unusual  capitaliza-tion (e.g.,  ITCorp  or  TeX ).  If a word is capitalized  incorrectly,the  list of possibilities will include all acceptable capitalizations.(More than one capitalization may be acceptable; for example,  my  dic-tionary lists both  ITCorp  and  ITcorp .)Normally,  this  feature will not cause you surprises, but there is onecircumstance you need to be aware of.  If you use  I  to add a word  to(1)    Any word may appear in all capitals, as in headings.(2)    Any  word  that  is  in the dictionary in all-lowercase form may       appear either in lowercase or capitalized (as at  the  beginning       of a sentence).(3)    Any word that has  funny  capitalization (i.e., it contains both       cases and there is an uppercase  character  besides  the  first)       must appear exactly as in the dictionary, except as permitted by       rule (1).  If the word is acceptable in all-lowercase,  it  must       appear thus in a dictionary entry.');
